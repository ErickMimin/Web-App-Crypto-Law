JOSH IS MARGOT'S BOYFRIEND, BUT I guess you could say my whole family is a little in love with him. It's hard to say who most of all. Before he was Margot's boyfriend, he was just Josh. He was always there. I say always, but I guess that's not true. He moved next door five years ago but it feels like always. My dad loves Josh because he's a boy and my dad is surrounded by girls. I mean it all day long he is surrounded by females. My dad is an ob-gyn, and he also happens to be the father of three daughters, so it's like girls, girls, girls all day. He also likes Josh because Josh likes comics and he'll go fishing with him. My dad tried to take us fishing once, and I cried when my shoes got mud on them, and Margot cried when her book got wet, and Kitty cried because Kitty was still practically a baby. Kitty loves Josh because he'll play cards with her and not get bored. Or at least pretend to not get bored. They make deals with each other-if I win this next hand, you have to make me a toasted crunchy-peanut-butter-sandwich, no crusts. That's Kitty. Inevitably there won't be crunchy peanut butter and Josh will say too bad, pick something else. But then Kitty will wear him down and he'll run out and buy some, because that's Josh. If I had to say why Margot loves him, I think maybe I would say it's because we all do. We are in the living room, Kitty is pasting pictures of dogs to a giant piece of cardboard. There's paper and scraps all around her. Humming to herself, she says, "When Daddy asks me what I want for Christmas, I am just going to say, 'Pick any one of these breeds and we'll be good.'?" Margot and Josh are on the couch; I'm lying on the floor, watching TV. Josh popped a big bowl of popcorn, and I devote myself to it, handfuls and handfuls of it. A commercial comes on for perfume: a girl is running around the streets of Paris in an orchid-colored halter dress that is thin as tissue paper. What I wouldn't give to be that girl in that tissue-paper dress running around Paris in springtime! I sit up so suddenly I choke on a kernel of popcorn. Between coughs I say, "Margot, let's meet in Paris for my spring break!" I'm already picturing myself twirling with a pistachio macaron in one hand and a raspberry one in the other. Margot's eyes light up. "Do you think Daddy will let you?" "Sure, it's culture. He'll have to let me." But it's true that I've never flown by myself before. And also I've never even left the country before. Would Margot meet me at the airport, or would I have to find my own way to the hostel? Josh must see the sudden worry on my face because he says, "Don't worry. Your dad will definitely let you go if I'm with you." It's later that night; Josh is long gone. Kitty and our dad are asleep. We are in the kitchen. Margot is at the table on her computer; I am sitting next to her, rolling cookie dough into balls and dropping them in cinnamon and sugar. Snickerdoodles to get back in Kitty's good graces. Earlier, when I went in to say good night, Kitty rolled over and wouldn't speak to me because she's still convinced I'm going to try to cut her out of the Paris trip. My plan is to put the snickerdoodles on a plate right next to her pillow so she wakes up to the smell of fresh-baked cookies. Margot rolls her eyes at this. She thinks I'm being dramatic, but I'm not. It's true-that's how much Josh loves Margot. He would never so much as look at another girl. "What?" For a moment I forget all about Josh. Because no matter what I am doing in life, if Margot and I are in the middle of an argument, if I am about to get hit by a car, I will always stop and listen to a story about Mommy. Any detail, any remembrance that Margot has, I want to have it too. I'm better off than Kitty, though. Kitty doesn't have one memory of Mommy that we haven't given her. We've told her so many stories so many times that they're hers now. "Remember that time ... ," she'll say. And then she'll tell the story like she was there and not just a little baby. I wave a spoonful of cookie dough under Margot's nose, and she hesitates and then opens her mouth. I feed it to her like a baby. "Wait and see, you and Josh will be back together in a day, maybe two." But even as I'm saying it, I know it's not true. Margot's not the kind of girl to break up and get back together on a whim; once she's decided something, that's it. There's no waffling, no regrets. It's like she said: when she's done, she's just done. I wish and this is a thought I've had many, many times, too many times to count I was more like Margot. Because sometimes it feels like I'll never be done. THE NEXT MORNING, MARGOT IS making coffee and I am pouring cereal in bowls, and I say the thing I've been thinking all morning. "Just so you know, Daddy and Kitty are going to be really upset." When Kitty and I were brushing our teeth just now, I was tempted to go ahead and spill the beans, but Kitty was still mad at me from yesterday, so I kept quiet. She didn't even acknowledge my cookies, though I know she ate them because all that was left on the plate were crumbs. When Margot decided to go to college in Scotland, it felt like a betrayal. Even though I knew it was coming, because of course she was going to go to college somewhere far away. And of course she was going to go to college in Scotland and study anthropology, because she is Margot, the girl with the maps and the travel books and the plans. Of course she would leave us one day. I'm still mad at her, just a little. Just a teeny-tiny bit. Obviously I know it's not her fault. But she's going so far away, and we always said we'd be the Song girls forever. Margot first, me in the middle, and my sister Kitty last. On her birth certificate she is Katherine; to us she is Kitty. Occasionally we call her Kitten, because that's what I called her when she was born: she looked like a scrawny, hairless kitten. I was probably the first kid ever excited for summer to be over. There was too much free time that summer, which can lead to too much thinking; especially for a loss-tricken eleven-year-old. I couldn't wait for seventh grade to start. Todivide into schoolwork. To distract myself from the loneliest facts. At one point, I regretted turning down Dad's offer to spend the summer in Ireland with Mom's family. But I knew that if I went, there would be reminders of her everywhere. Not like there wasn't one every time I looked in the mirror. So the only escape I had was school. When I got the message that I was to report to the main office before class, I was worried I'd be faced with another year of forced visits with the school counselor, looks of pity from my fellow classmates, and well-meaning but oblivious faculty members who kept telling me it was "important to keep her memory alive". Like I could ever forget her. I wasn't ready for any additional drama that morning. It was ready the firs day of a new school year since. "Do you want me to go with you, Macallan?" Emily asked after I received my summons to the office. A tight smile on her face gave away the concern she thought she was hiding. She studied me for a second before adjusting my hair clip. I gave her a reassuring smile and kept it on my face as I entered the office. Principal Blaska greeted me with a hug. "Welcome back, Macallan! How was yout summer?" "Great" I lied. We both stares at each other, neither knowing what to say next. "Well, I'm going to need your assistance today with a new student. Meet Levi Rodgers - he's from Los Angeles!" I looked over and saw this boy with long blond hair pulled into a low ponytail. His hair was even longer than mine. He tucked a loose strand behind his ear before he reached out his hand and said, "hey". I had to give him credit - at least he had manners...for a surfer dude. Principal Blaska handed me his schedule. "Could you show him around and take him to his first class?" "Of course" I led Levi out into the hallway and started giving him the five-cent tour. A few friends passed by to say hello, everuone checking out the new guy. Our school was fairly small; the majority of us had been together since fifth grade, if not kindergarten. I stole another glance at him. It was hard to decipher if he was cute. His hair was practically white in places, probably from the sun. His tan made his light hair and pale eyes stick our even more - but this wouldn't be for very long, since in Winsconsin we rarely see the sun past August. Levi had on a checkered button-down paired with long cargo shorts and flip-flops. It was as if he couldn't decide whether to dress up or be casual. I luckily had Emily to help me pick out my firs day of school outfit that day: a bright yellow and white striped sundress with a withe cardigan. I was so thankful that I had a girly girl friend like Emily. My dad, as much as he tried, couldn't really hel me out with thing like hair, clothes, and makeup. If left to his own devices, I'd wear jeans, sneakers, and a Green Bay Packets T-shirt every day, and eat pizza for every meal. And Emily was a girl as you could get. She was easily one of the prettiest girls in our class, with long, shiny jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. She also had the best clothes, and I was so glad we were the same size so I could borrow them, although se was alredy way more developed than I was. At least I would have someone to go to once I needed a bra. I couldn't even imagine how awkward that would be for Dad. For both us.I gave Levu a quick smile, hoping to undo some of the rudeness from the morning. He returned with a sad wave. I paused for a second, and in that second, I notice the look of gratitude on Levi's face. He was expecting me to sit with him or the least invite him over. I hesitated, unsure what to do. I didn't want to play babysister, but I laso knew what it was like be alone. And scared. We talked a little more about summers, and when it was time to go, I made sure Levi knew where he was going next. It was pretty cool to have someone around here who didn't like the same things as everybody else. Uncle Adam was waiting for me after school to take me home. He was always excited to see me, even if he'd dropped me off only a few hours ago. Levi was getting into an SUV with a woman I assumed was his mom. He said something to her and she started to walk over to us. With some reluctance, he followed. A knot began to form tightly in my stomach. I always got defensive whenever anybody met Adam for the first time. I stood there silently for a few seconds. I was used to Mudwestern politeness, but here was a woman whod just moved to town and I'd just met, and she was alredy offerind her home to me. And she was doing it out of niceness, not because she knew about the accident. Levi pointed to the button on his bag, his eyebrow arching in a playful manner. I imagined us watching Buggy and Floyd together. I do, I mouthed back. The two adults echanged phone numbers. The negative me said Levi's mom was doing this because she thought my uncle was unfit to look after me. The positive me said she was a nice person who wanted her son to have friends. kept quiet.

I stole another glance at him. It was hard to decipher if he was cute. His hair was practically white in places, probably from the sun. His tan made his light hair and pale eyes stick our even more - but this wouldn't be for very long, since in Winsconsin we rarely see the sun past August. Levi had on a checkered button-down paired with long cargo shorts and flip-flops. It was as if he couldn't decide whether to dress up or be casual. I luckily had Emily to help me pick out my firs day of school outfit that day: a bright yellow and white striped sundress with a withe cardigan. I was so thankful that I had a girly girl friend like Emily. My dad, as much as he tried, couldn't really hel me out with thing like hair, clothes, and makeup. If left to his own devices, I'd wear jeans, sneakers, and a Green Bay Packets T-shirt every day, and eat pizza for every meal. And Emily was a girl as you could get. She was easily one of the prettiest girls in our class, with long, shiny jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. She also had the best clothes, and I was so glad we were the same size so I could borrow them, although se was alredy way more developed than I was. At least I would have someone to go to once I needed a bra. I couldn't even imagine how awkward that would be for Dad. For both us.I gave Levu a quick smile, hoping to undo some of the rudeness from the morning. He returned with a sad wave. I paused for a second, and in that second, I notice the look of gratitude on Levi's face. He was expecting me to sit with him or the least invite him over. I hesitated, unsure what to do. I didn't want to play babysister, but I laso knew what it was like be alone. And scared. We talked a little more about summers, and when it was time to go, I made sure Levi knew where he was going next. It was pretty cool to have someone around here who didn't like the same things as everybody else. Uncle Adam was waiting for me after school to take me home. He was always excited to see me, even if he'd dropped me off only a few hours ago. Levi was getting into an SUV with a woman I assumed was his mom. He said something to her and she started to walk over to us. With some reluctance, he followed. A knot began to form tightly in my stomach. I always got defensive whenever anybody met Adam for the first time. I stood there silently for a few seconds. I was used to Mudwestern politeness, but here was a woman whod just moved to town and I'd just met, and she was alredy offerind her home to me. And she was doing it out of niceness, not because she knew about the accident. Levi pointed to the button on his bag, his eyebrow arching in a playful manner. I imagined us watching Buggy and Floyd together. I do, I mouthed back. The two adults echanged phone numbers. The negative me said Levi's mom was doing this because she thought my uncle was unfit to look after me. The positive me said she was a nice person who wanted her son to have friends. kept quiet. She didn't even acknowledge my cookies, though I know she ate them because all that was left on the plate were crumbs. When Margot decided to go to college in Scotland, it felt like a betrayal. Even though I knew it was coming, because of course she was going to go to college somewhere far away. And of course she was going to go to college in Scotland and study anthropology, because she is Margot, the girl with the maps and the travel books and the plans. Of course she would leave us one day. I'm still mad at her, just a little. Just a teeny-tiny bit. Obviously I know it's not her fault. But she's going so far away, and we always said we'd be the Song girls forever. Margot first, me in the middle, and my sister Kitty last. On her birth certificate she is Katherine; to us she is Kitty. Occasionally we call her Kitten, because that's what I called her when she was born: she looked like a scrawny, hairless kitten. I was probably the first kid ever excited for summer to be over. There was too much free time that summer, which can lead to too much thinking; especially for a loss-tricken eleven-year-old. I couldn't wait for seventh grade to start. Todivide into schoolwork. To distract myself from the loneliest facts. At one point, I regretted turning down Dad's offer to spend the summer in Ireland with Mom's family. But I knew that if I went, there would be reminders of her everywhere. Not like there wasn't one every time I looked in the mirror. So the only escape I had was school. When I got the message that I was to report to the main office before class, I was worried I'd be faced with another year of forced visits with the school counselor, looks of pity from my fellow classmates, and well-meaning but oblivious faculty members who kept telling me it was "important to keep her memory alive". Like I could ever forget her. I wasn't ready for any additional drama that morning. It was ready the firs day of a new school year since. "Do you want me to go with you, Macallan?" Emily asked after I received my summons to the office. A tight smile on her face gave away the concern she thought she was hiding. She studied me for a second before adjusting my hair clip. I gave her a reassuring smile and kept it on my face as I entered the office. Principal Blaska greeted me with a hug. "Welcome back, Macallan! How was yout summer?" "Great" I lied. We both stares at each other, neither knowing what to say next. "Well, I'm going to need your assistance today with a new student. Meet Levi Rodgers - he's from Los Angeles!" I looked over and saw this boy with long blond hair pulled into a low ponytail. His hair was even longer than mine. He tucked a loose strand behind his ear before he reached out his hand and said, "hey". I had to give him credit - at least he had manners...for a surfer dude. Principal Blaska handed me his schedule. "Could you show him around and take him to his first class?" "Of course" I led Levi out into the hallway and started giving him the five-cent tour.

He was always excited to see me, even if he'd dropped me off only a few hours ago. Levi was getting into an SUV with a woman I assumed was his mom. He said something to her and she started to walk over to us. With some reluctance, he followed. A knot began to form tightly in my stomach. I always got defensive whenever anybody met Adam for the first time. I stood there silently for a few seconds. I was used to Mudwestern politeness, but here was a woman whod just moved to town and I'd just met, and she was alredy offerind her home to me. And she was doing it out of niceness, not because she knew about the accident. Levi pointed to the button on his bag, his eyebrow arching in a playful manner. I imagined us watching Buggy and Floyd together. I do, I mouthed back. The two adults echanged phone numbers. The negative me said Levi's mom was doing this because she thought my uncle was unfit to look after me. The positive me said she was a nice person who wanted her son to have friends. kept quiet. She didn't even acknowledge my cookies, though I know she ate them because all that was left on the plate were crumbs. When Margot decided to go to college in Scotland, it felt like a betrayal. Even though I knew it was coming, because of course she was going to go to college somewhere far away. And of course she was going to go to college in Scotland and study anthropology, because she is Margot, the girl with the maps and the travel books and the plans. Of course she would leave us one day. I'm still mad at her, just a little. Just a teeny-tiny bit. Obviously I know it's not her fault. But she's going so far away, and we always said we'd be the Song girls forever. Margot first, me in the middle, and my sister Kitty last. On her birth certificate she is Katherine; to us she is Kitty. Occasionally we call her Kitten, because that's what I called her when she was born: she looked like a scrawny, hairless kitten. I was probably the first kid ever excited for summer to be over. There was too much free time that summer, which can lead to too much thinking; especially for a loss-tricken eleven-year-old. I couldn't wait for seventh grade to start. Todivide into schoolwork. To distract myself from the loneliest facts. At one point, I regretted turning down Dad's offer to spend the summer in Ireland with Mom's family. But I knew that if I went, there would be reminders of her everywhere. Not like there wasn't one every time I looked in the mirror. So the only escape I had was school. When I got the message that I was to report to the main office before class, I was worried I'd be faced with another year of forced visits with the school counselor, looks of pity from my fellow classmates, and well-meaning but oblivious faculty members who kept telling me it was "important to keep her memory alive". Like I could ever forget her. I wasn't ready for any additional drama that morning. It was ready the firs day of a new school year since. "Do you want me to go with you, Macallan?" Emily asked after I received my summons to the office. A tight smile on her face gave away the concern she thought she was hiding. She studied me for a second before adjusting my hair clip. I gave her a reassuring smile and kept it on my face as I entered the office. Principal Blaska greeted me with a hug. "Welcome back, Macallan! How was yout summer?" "Great" I lied. We both stares at each other, neither knowing what to say next. "Well, I'm going to need your assistance today with a new student. Meet Levi Rodgers - he's from Los Angeles!" I looked over and saw this boy with long blond hair pulled into a low ponytail. His hair was even longer than mine. He tucked a loose strand behind his ear before he reached out his hand and said, "hey". I had to give him credit - at least he had manners...for a surfer dude. Principal Blaska handed me his schedule. "Could you show him around and take him to his first class?" "Of course" I led Levi out into the hallway and started giving him the five-cent tour. A few friends passed by to say hello, everuone checking out the new guy. Our school was fairly small; the majority of us had been together since fifth grade, if not kindergarten. I stole another glance at him. It was hard to decipher if he was cute. His hair was practically white in places, probably from the sun. His tan made his light hair and pale eyes stick our even more - but this wouldn't be for very long, since in Winsconsin we rarely see the sun past August. Levi had on a checkered button-down paired with long cargo shorts and flip-flops. It was as if he couldn't decide whether to dress up or be casual. I luckily had Emily to help me pick out my firs day of school outfit that day: a bright yellow and white striped sundress with a withe cardigan. I was so thankful that I had a girly girl friend like Emily. My dad, as much as he tried, couldn't really hel me out with thing like hair, clothes, and makeup. If left to his own devices, I'd wear jeans, sneakers, and a Green Bay Packets T-shirt every day, and eat pizza for every meal. And Emily was a girl as you could get. She was easily one of the prettiest girls in our class, with long, shiny jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. She also had the best clothes, and I was so glad we were the same size so I could borrow them, although se was alredy way more developed than I was. At least I would have someone to go to once I needed a bra. I couldn't even imagine how awkward that would be for Dad. For both us.I gave Levu a quick smile, hoping to undo some of the rudeness from the morning. He returned with a sad wave. I paused for a second, and in that second, I notice the look of gratitude on Levi's face. He was expecting me to sit with him or the least invite him over. I hesitated, unsure what to do. I didn't want to play babysister, but I laso knew what it was like be alone. And scared.

I couldn't wait for seventh grade to start. Todivide into schoolwork. To distract myself from the loneliest facts. At one point, I regretted turning down Dad's offer to spend the summer in Ireland with Mom's family. But I knew that if I went, there would be reminders of her everywhere. Not like there wasn't one every time I looked in the mirror. So the only escape I had was school. When I got the message that I was to report to the main office before class, I was worried I'd be faced with another year of forced visits with the school counselor, looks of pity from my fellow classmates, and well-meaning but oblivious faculty members who kept telling me it was "important to keep her memory alive". Like I could ever forget her. I wasn't ready for any additional drama that morning. It was ready the firs day of a new school year since. "Do you want me to go with you, Macallan?" Emily asked after I received my summons to the office. A tight smile on her face gave away the concern she thought she was hiding. She studied me for a second before adjusting my hair clip. I gave her a reassuring smile and kept it on my face as I entered the office. Principal Blaska greeted me with a hug. "Welcome back, Macallan! How was yout summer?" "Great" I lied. We both stares at each other, neither knowing what to say next. "Well, I'm going to need your assistance today with a new student. Meet Levi Rodgers - he's from Los Angeles!" I looked over and saw this boy with long blond hair pulled into a low ponytail. His hair was even longer than mine. He tucked a loose strand behind his ear before he reached out his hand and said, "hey". I had to give him credit - at least he had manners...for a surfer dude. Principal Blaska handed me his schedule. "Could you show him around and take him to his first class?" "Of course" I led Levi out into the hallway and started giving him the five-cent tour. A few friends passed by to say hello, everuone checking out the new guy. Our school was fairly small; the majority of us had been together since fifth grade, if not kindergarten. I stole another glance at him. It was hard to decipher if he was cute. His hair was practically white in places, probably from the sun. His tan made his light hair and pale eyes stick our even more - but this wouldn't be for very long, since in Winsconsin we rarely see the sun past August. Levi had on a checkered button-down paired with long cargo shorts and flip-flops. It was as if he couldn't decide whether to dress up or be casual. I luckily had Emily to help me pick out my firs day of school outfit that day: a bright yellow and white striped sundress with a withe cardigan. I was so thankful that I had a girly girl friend like Emily. My dad, as much as he tried, couldn't really hel me out with thing like hair, clothes, and makeup. If left to his own devices, I'd wear jeans, sneakers, and a Green Bay Packets T-shirt every day, and eat pizza for every meal. And Emily was a girl as you could get. She was easily one of the prettiest girls in our class, with long, shiny jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. She also had the best clothes, and I was so glad we were the same size so I could borrow them, although se was alredy way more developed than I was. At least I would have someone to go to once I needed a bra. I couldn't even imagine how awkward that would be for Dad. For both us.I gave Levu a quick smile, hoping to undo some of the rudeness from the morning. He returned with a sad wave. I paused for a second, and in that second, I notice the look of gratitude on Levi's face. He was expecting me to sit with him or the least invite him over. I hesitated, unsure what to do. I didn't want to play babysister, but I laso knew what it was like be alone. And scared. We talked a little more about summers, and when it was time to go, I made sure Levi knew where he was going next. It was pretty cool to have someone around here who didn't like the same things as everybody else. Uncle Adam was waiting for me after school to take me home. He was always excited to see me, even if he'd dropped me off only a few hours ago. Levi was getting into an SUV with a woman I assumed was his mom. He said something to her and she started to walk over to us. With some reluctance, he followed. A knot began to form tightly in my stomach. I always got defensive whenever anybody met Adam for the first time. I stood there silently for a few seconds. I was used to Mudwestern politeness, but here was a woman whod just moved to town and I'd just met, and she was alredy offerind her home to me. And she was doing it out of niceness, not because she knew about the accident. Levi pointed to the button on his bag, his eyebrow arching in a playful manner. I imagined us watching Buggy and Floyd together. I was probably the first kid ever excited for summer to be over.

I imagined us watching Buggy and Floyd together. I do, I mouthed back. The two adults echanged phone numbers. The negative me said Levi's mom was doing this because she thought my uncle was unfit to look after me. The positive me said she was a nice person who wanted her son to have friends. A Fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree. The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them. The bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it. The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. Again and again he tried, but in vain. Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust. What a fool I am, he said. Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for. And off he walked very, very scornfully. Moral of the fable: There are many who pretend to despise and belittle that which is beyond their reach. A Wolf found great difficulty in getting at the sheep owing to the vigilance of the shepherd and his dogs. But one day it found the skin of a sheep that had been flayed and thrown aside, so it put it on over its own pelt and strolled down among the sheep. The Lamb that belonged to the sheep, whose skin the Wolf was wearing, began to follow the Wolf in the Sheep's clothing; so, leading the Lamb a little apart, he soon made a meal off her, and for some time he succeeded in deceiving the sheep, and enjoying hearty meals. JOSH IS MARGOT'S BOYFRIEND, BUT I guess you could say my whole family is a little in love with him. It's hard to say who most of all. Before he was Margot's boyfriend, he was just Josh. He was always there. I say always, but I guess that's not true. He moved next door five years ago but it feels like always. My dad loves Josh because he's a boy and my dad is surrounded by girls. I mean it all day long he is surrounded by females. My dad is an ob-gyn, and he also happens to be the father of three daughters, so it's like girls, girls, girls all day. He also likes Josh because Josh likes comics and he'll go fishing with him. My dad tried to take us fishing once, and I cried when my shoes got mud on them, and Margot cried when her book got wet, and Kitty cried because Kitty was still practically a baby. Kitty loves Josh because he'll play cards with her and not get bored. Or at least pretend to not get bored. They make deals with each other-if I win this next hand, you have to make me a toasted crunchy-peanut-butter-sandwich, no crusts. That's Kitty. Inevitably there won't be crunchy peanut butter and Josh will say too bad, pick something else. But then Kitty will wear him down and he'll run out and buy some, because that's Josh. If I had to say why Margot loves him, I think maybe I would say it's because we all do. We are in the living room, Kitty is pasting pictures of dogs to a giant piece of cardboard. There's paper and scraps all around her. Humming to herself, she says, "When Daddy asks me what I want for Christmas, I am just going to say, 'Pick any one of these breeds and we'll be good.'?" Margot and Josh are on the couch; I'm lying on the floor, watching TV. Josh popped a big bowl of popcorn, and I devote myself to it, handfuls and handfuls of it. A commercial comes on for perfume: a girl is running around the streets of Paris in an orchid-colored halter dress that is thin as tissue paper. What I wouldn't give to be that girl in that tissue-paper dress running around Paris in springtime! I sit up so suddenly I choke on a kernel of popcorn. Between coughs I say, "Margot, let's meet in Paris for my spring break!" I'm already picturing myself twirling with a pistachio macaron in one hand and a raspberry one in the other. Margot's eyes light up. "Do you think Daddy will let you?" "Sure, it's culture. He'll have to let me." But it's true that I've never flown by myself before. And also I've never even left the country before. Would Margot meet me at the airport, or would I have to find my own way to the hostel? Josh must see the sudden worry on my face because he says, "Don't worry. Your dad will definitely let you go if I'm with you." It's later that night; Josh is long gone. Kitty and our dad are asleep. We are in the kitchen. Margot is at the table on her computer; I am sitting next to her, rolling cookie dough into balls and dropping them in cinnamon and sugar. Snickerdoodles to get back in Kitty's good graces. Earlier, when I went in to say good night, Kitty rolled over and wouldn't speak to me because she's still convinced I'm going to try to cut her out of the Paris trip. My plan is to put the snickerdoodles on a plate right next to her pillow so she wakes up to the smell of fresh-baked cookies. Margot rolls her eyes at this. She thinks I'm being dramatic, but I'm not. It's true-that's how much Josh loves Margot. He would never so much as look at another girl. "What?" For a moment I forget all about Josh. Because no matter what I am doing in life, if Margot and I are in the middle of an argument, if I am about to get hit by a car, I will always stop and listen to a story about Mommy. Any detail, any remembrance that Margot has, I want to have it too. I'm better off than Kitty, though. Kitty doesn't have one memory of Mommy that we haven't given her. We've told her so many stories so many times that they're hers now. "Remember that time ... ," she'll say. And then she'll tell the story like she was there and not just a little baby. I wave a spoonful of cookie dough under Margot's nose, and she hesitates and then opens her mouth. I feed it to her like a baby. "Wait and see, you and Josh will be back together in a day, maybe two." But even as I'm saying it, I know it's not true. Margot's not the kind of girl to break up and get back together on a whim; once she's decided something, that's it. There's no waffling, no regrets. It's like she said: when she's done, she's just done. I wish and this is a thought I've had many, many times, too many times to count I was more like Margot. Because sometimes it feels like I'll never be done. THE NEXT MORNING, MARGOT IS making coffee and I am pouring cereal in bowls, and I say the thing I've been thinking all morning. "Just so you know, Daddy and Kitty are going to be really upset." When Kitty and I were brushing our teeth just now, I was tempted to go ahead and spill the beans, but Kitty was still mad at me from yesterday, so I kept quiet. She didn't even acknowledge my cookies, though I know she ate them because all that was left on the plate were crumbs. When Margot decided to go to college in Scotland, it felt like a betrayal. Even though I knew it was coming, because of course she was going to go to college somewhere far away. And of course she was going to go to college in Scotland and study anthropology, because she is Margot, the girl with the maps and the travel books and the plans. Of course she would leave us one day. I'm still mad at her, just a little. Just a teeny-tiny bit. Obviously I know it's not her fault. But she's going so far away, and we always said we'd be the Song girls forever. Margot first, me in the middle, and my sister Kitty last. On her birth certificate she is Katherine; to us she is Kitty. Occasionally we call her Kitten, because that's what I called her when she was born: she looked like a scrawny, hairless kitten. I was probably the first kid ever excited for summer to be over. There was too much free time that summer, which can lead to too much thinking; especially for a loss-tricken eleven-year-old.

If left to his own devices, I'd wear jeans, sneakers, and a Green Bay Packets T-shirt every day, and eat pizza for every meal. And Emily was a girl as you could get. She was easily one of the prettiest girls in our class, with long, shiny jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. She also had the best clothes, and I was so glad we were the same size so I could borrow them, although se was alredy way more developed than I was. At least I would have someone to go to once I needed a bra. I couldn't even imagine how awkward that would be for Dad. For both us.I gave Levu a quick smile, hoping to undo some of the rudeness from the morning. He returned with a sad wave. I paused for a second, and in that second, I notice the look of gratitude on Levi's face. He was expecting me to sit with him or the least invite him over. I hesitated, unsure what to do. I didn't want to play babysister, but I laso knew what it was like be alone. And scared. We talked a little more about summers, and when it was time to go, I made sure Levi knew where he was going next. It was pretty cool to have someone around here who didn't like the same things as everybody else. Uncle Adam was waiting for me after school to take me home. He was always excited to see me, even if he'd dropped me off only a few hours ago. Levi was getting into an SUV with a woman I assumed was his mom. He said something to her and she started to walk over to us. With some reluctance, he followed. A knot began to form tightly in my stomach. I always got defensive whenever anybody met Adam for the first time. I stood there silently for a few seconds. I was used to Mudwestern politeness, but here was a woman whod just moved to town and I'd just met, and she was alredy offerind her home to me. And she was doing it out of niceness, not because she knew about the accident. Levi pointed to the button on his bag, his eyebrow arching in a playful manner. I imagined us watching Buggy and Floyd together. I do, I mouthed back. The two adults echanged phone numbers. The negative me said Levi's mom was doing this because she thought my uncle was unfit to look after me. The positive me said she was a nice person who wanted her son to have friends. kept quiet. She didn't even acknowledge my cookies, though I know she ate them because all that was left on the plate were crumbs. When Margot decided to go to college in Scotland, it felt like a betrayal. Even though I knew it was coming, because of course she was going to go to college somewhere far away. And of course she was going to go to college in Scotland and study anthropology, because she is Margot, the girl with the maps and the travel books and the plans. Of course she would leave us one day. I'm still mad at her, just a little. Just a teeny-tiny bit. Obviously I know it's not her fault. But she's going so far away, and we always said we'd be the Song girls forever. Margot first, me in the middle, and my sister Kitty last. On her birth certificate she is Katherine; to us she is Kitty. Occasionally we call her Kitten, because that's what I called her when she was born: she looked like a scrawny, hairless kitten. I was probably the first kid ever excited for summer to be over. There was too much free time that summer, which can lead to too much thinking; especially for a loss-tricken eleven-year-old. I couldn't wait for seventh grade to start. Todivide into schoolwork. To distract myself from the loneliest facts. At one point, I regretted turning down Dad's offer to spend the summer in Ireland with Mom's family. But I knew that if I went, there would be reminders of her everywhere. Not like there wasn't one every time I looked in the mirror. So the only escape I had was school. When I got the message that I was to report to the main office before class, I was worried I'd be faced with another year of forced visits with the school counselor, looks of pity from my fellow classmates, and well-meaning but oblivious faculty members who kept telling me it was "important to keep her memory alive". Like I could ever forget her. I wasn't ready for any additional drama that morning. It was ready the firs day of a new school year since. "Do you want me to go with you, Macallan?" Emily asked after I received my summons to the office. A tight smile on her face gave away the concern she thought she was hiding. She studied me for a second before adjusting my hair clip. I gave her a reassuring smile and kept it on my face as I entered the office. Principal Blaska greeted me with a hug. "Welcome back, Macallan! How was yout summer?" "Great" I lied. We both stares at each other, neither knowing what to say next. "Well, I'm going to need your assistance today with a new student. Meet Levi Rodgers - he's from Los Angeles!" I looked over and saw this boy with long blond hair pulled into a low ponytail. His hair was even longer than mine. He tucked a loose strand behind his ear before he reached out his hand and said, "hey". I had to give him credit - at least he had manners...for a surfer dude. Principal Blaska handed me his schedule. "Could you show him around and take him to his first class?" "Of course" I led Levi out into the hallway and started giving him the five-cent tour. A few friends passed by to say hello, everuone checking out the new guy. Our school was fairly small; the majority of us had been together since fifth grade, if not kindergarten. I stole another glance at him. It was hard to decipher if he was cute. His hair was practically white in places, probably from the sun. His tan made his light hair and pale eyes stick our even more - but this wouldn't be for very long, since in Winsconsin we rarely see the sun past August. Levi had on a checkered button-down paired with long cargo shorts and flip-flops. It was as if he couldn't decide whether to dress up or be casual.

The negative me said Levi's mom was doing this because she thought my uncle was unfit to look after me. The positive me said she was a nice person who wanted her son to have friends.kept quiet. She didn't even acknowledge my cookies, though I know she ate them because all that was left on the plate were crumbs. When Margot decided to go to college in Scotland, it felt like a betrayal. Even though I knew it was coming, because of course she was going to go to college somewhere far away. And of course she was going to go to college in Scotland and study anthropology, because she is Margot, the girl with the maps and the travel books and the plans. Of course she would leave us one day. I'm still mad at her, just a little. Just a teeny-tiny bit. Obviously I know it's not her fault. But she's going so far away, and we always said we'd be the Song girls forever. Margot first, me in the middle, and my sister Kitty last. On her birth certificate she is Katherine; to us she is Kitty. Occasionally we call her Kitten, because that's what I called her when she was born: she looked like a scrawny, hairless kitten. I was probably the first kid ever excited for summer to be over. There was too much free time that summer, which can lead to too much thinking; especially for a loss-tricken eleven-year-old. I couldn't wait for seventh grade to start. Todivide into schoolwork. To distract myself from the loneliest facts. At one point, I regretted turning down Dad's offer to spend the summer in Ireland with Mom's family. But I knew that if I went, there would be reminders of her everywhere. Not like there wasn't one every time I looked in the mirror. So the only escape I had was school. When I got the message that I was to report to the main office before class, I was worried I'd be faced with another year of forced visits with the school counselor, looks of pity from my fellow classmates, and well-meaning but oblivious faculty members who kept telling me it was "important to keep her memory alive". Like I could ever forget her. I wasn't ready for any additional drama that morning. It was ready the firs day of a new school year since. "Do you want me to go with you, Macallan?" Emily asked after I received my summons to the office. A tight smile on her face gave away the concern she thought she was hiding. She studied me for a second before adjusting my hair clip. I gave her a reassuring smile and kept it on my face as I entered the office. Principal Blaska greeted me with a hug. "Welcome back, Macallan! How was yout summer?" "Great" I lied. We both stares at each other, neither knowing what to say next. "Well, I'm going to need your assistance today with a new student. Meet Levi Rodgers - he's from Los Angeles!" I looked over and saw this boy with long blond hair pulled into a low ponytail. His hair was even longer than mine. He tucked a loose strand behind his ear before he reached out his hand and said, "hey". I had to give him credit - at least he had manners...for a surfer dude. Principal Blaska handed me his schedule. "Could you show him around and take him to his first class?" "Of course" I led Levi out into the hallway and started giving him the five-cent tour. A few friends passed by to say hello, everuone checking out the new guy. Our school was fairly small; the majority of us had been together since fifth grade, if not kindergarten. I stole another glance at him. It was hard to decipher if he was cute. His hair was practically white in places, probably from the sun. His tan made his light hair and pale eyes stick our even more - but this wouldn't be for very long, since in Winsconsin we rarely see the sun past August. Levi had on a checkered button-down paired with long cargo shorts and flip-flops. It was as if he couldn't decide whether to dress up or be casual. I luckily had Emily to help me pick out my firs day of school outfit that day: a bright yellow and white striped sundress with a withe cardigan. I was so thankful that I had a girly girl friend like Emily. My dad, as much as he tried, couldn't really hel me out with thing like hair, clothes, and makeup. If left to his own devices, I'd wear jeans, sneakers, and a Green Bay Packets T-shirt every day, and eat pizza for every meal. And Emily was a girl as you could get. She was easily one of the prettiest girls in our class, with long, shiny jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. She also had the best clothes, and I was so glad we were the same size so I could borrow them, although se was alredy way more developed than I was. At least I would have someone to go to once I needed a bra. I couldn't even imagine how awkward that would be for Dad. For both us.I gave Levu a quick smile, hoping to undo some of the rudeness from the morning. He returned with a sad wave. I paused for a second, and in that second, I notice the look of gratitude on Levi's face. He was expecting me to sit with him or the least invite him over. I hesitated, unsure what to do. I didn't want to play babysister, but I laso knew what it was like be alone. And scared. We talked a little more about summers, and when it was time to go, I made sure Levi knew where he was going next. It was pretty cool to have someone around here who didn't like the same things as everybody else. Uncle Adam was waiting for me after school to take me home. He was always excited to see me, even if he'd dropped me off only a few hours ago. Levi was getting into an SUV with a woman I assumed was his mom. He said something to her and she started to walk over to us. With some reluctance, he followed. A knot began to form tightly in my stomach. I always got defensive whenever anybody met Adam for the first time. I stood there silently for a few seconds. I was used to Mudwestern politeness, but here was a woman whod just moved to town and I'd just met, and she was alredy offerind her home to me. And she was doing it out of niceness, not because she knew about the accident. Levi pointed to the button on his bag, his eyebrow arching in a playful manner. I imagined us watching Buggy and Floyd together. I do, I mouthed back. The two adults echanged phone numbers.

Emily asked after I received my summons to the office. A tight smile on her face gave away the concern she thought she was hiding. She studied me for a second before adjusting my hair clip. I gave her a reassuring smile and kept it on my face as I entered the office. Principal Blaska greeted me with a hug. "Welcome back, Macallan! How was yout summer?" "Great" I lied. We both stares at each other, neither knowing what to say next. "Well, I'm going to need your assistance today with a new student. Meet Levi Rodgers - he's from Los Angeles!" I looked over and saw this boy with long blond hair pulled into a low ponytail. His hair was even longer than mine. He tucked a loose strand behind his ear before he reached out his hand and said, "hey". I had to give him credit - at least he had manners...for a surfer dude. Principal Blaska handed me his schedule. "Could you show him around and take him to his first class?" "Of course" I led Levi out into the hallway and started giving him the five-cent tour. A few friends passed by to say hello, everuone checking out the new guy. Our school was fairly small; the majority of us had been together since fifth grade, if not kindergarten. I stole another glance at him. It was hard to decipher if he was cute. His hair was practically white in places, probably from the sun. His tan made his light hair and pale eyes stick our even more - but this wouldn't be for very long, since in Winsconsin we rarely see the sun past August. Levi had on a checkered button-down paired with long cargo shorts and flip-flops. It was as if he couldn't decide whether to dress up or be casual. I luckily had Emily to help me pick out my firs day of school outfit that day: a bright yellow and white striped sundress with a withe cardigan. I was so thankful that I had a girly girl friend like Emily. My dad, as much as he tried, couldn't really hel me out with thing like hair, clothes, and makeup. If left to his own devices, I'd wear jeans, sneakers, and a Green Bay Packets T-shirt every day, and eat pizza for every meal. And Emily was a girl as you could get. She was easily one of the prettiest girls in our class, with long, shiny jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. She also had the best clothes, and I was so glad we were the same size so I could borrow them, although se was alredy way more developed than I was. At least I would have someone to go to once I needed a bra. I couldn't even imagine how awkward that would be for Dad. For both us.I gave Levu a quick smile, hoping to undo some of the rudeness from the morning. He returned with a sad wave. I paused for a second, and in that second, I notice the look of gratitude on Levi's face. He was expecting me to sit with him or the least invite him over. I hesitated, unsure what to do. I didn't want to play babysister, but I laso knew what it was like be alone. And scared. We talked a little more about summers, and when it was time to go, I made sure Levi knew where he was going next. It was pretty cool to have someone around here who didn't like the same things as everybody else. Uncle Adam was waiting for me after school to take me home. He was always excited to see me, even if he'd dropped me off only a few hours ago. Levi was getting into an SUV with a woman I assumed was his mom. He said something to her and she started to walk over to us. With some reluctance, he followed. A knot began to form tightly in my stomach. I always got defensive whenever anybody met Adam for the first time. I stood there silently for a few seconds. I was used to Mudwestern politeness, but here was a woman whod just moved to town and I'd just met, and she was alredy offerind her home to me. And she was doing it out of niceness, not because she knew about the accident. Levi pointed to the button on his bag, his eyebrow arching in a playful manner. I imagined us watching Buggy and Floyd together. I do, I mouthed back. The two adults echanged phone numbers. The negative me said Levi's mom was doing this because she thought my uncle was unfit to look after me. The positive me said she was a nice person who wanted her son to have friends. kept quiet. She didn't even acknowledge my cookies, though I know she ate them because all that was left on the plate were crumbs. When Margot decided to go to college in Scotland, it felt like a betrayal. Even though I knew it was coming, because of course she was going to go to college somewhere far away. And of course she was going to go to college in Scotland and study anthropology, because she is Margot, the girl with the maps and the travel books and the plans. Of course she would leave us one day. I'm still mad at her, just a little. Just a teeny-tiny bit. Obviously I know it's not her fault. But she's going so far away, and we always said we'd be the Song girls forever. Margot first, me in the middle, and my sister Kitty last. On her birth certificate she is Katherine; to us she is Kitty. Occasionally we call her Kitten, because that's what I called her when she was born: she looked like a scrawny, hairless kitten. I was probably the first kid ever excited for summer to be over. There was too much free time that summer, which can lead to too much thinking; especially for a loss-tricken eleven-year-old. I couldn't wait for seventh grade to start. Todivide into schoolwork. To distract myself from the loneliest facts. At one point, I regretted turning down Dad's offer to spend the summer in Ireland with Mom's family. But I knew that if I went, there would be reminders of her everywhere.

A Fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree. The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them. The bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it. The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. Again and again he tried, but in vain. Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust. What a fool I am, he said. Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for. And off he walked very, very scornfully. Moral of the fable: There are many who pretend to despise and belittle that which is beyond their reach. A Wolf found great difficulty in getting at the sheep owing to the vigilance of the shepherd and his dogs. But one day it found the skin of a sheep that had been flayed and thrown aside, so it put it on over its own pelt and strolled down among the sheep. The Lamb that belonged to the sheep, whose skin the Wolf was wearing, began to follow the Wolf in the Sheep's clothing; so, leading the Lamb a little apart, he soon made a meal off her, and for some time he succeeded in deceiving the sheep, and enjoying hearty meals.

For both us.I gave Levu a quick smile, hoping to undo some of the rudeness from the morning. He returned with a sad wave. I paused for a second, and in that second, I notice the look of gratitude on Levi's face. He was expecting me to sit with him or the least invite him over. I hesitated, unsure what to do. I didn't want to play babysister, but I laso knew what it was like be alone. And scared. We talked a little more about summers, and when it was time to go, I made sure Levi knew where he was going next. It was pretty cool to have someone around here who didn't like the same things as everybody else. Uncle Adam was waiting for me after school to take me home. He was always excited to see me, even if he'd dropped me off only a few hours ago. Levi was getting into an SUV with a woman I assumed was his mom. He said something to her and she started to walk over to us. With some reluctance, he followed. A knot began to form tightly in my stomach. I always got defensive whenever anybody met Adam for the first time. I stood there silently for a few seconds. I do, I mouthed back. The two adults echanged phone numbers. The negative me said Levi's mom was doing this because she thought my uncle was unfit to look after me. The positive me said she was a nice person who wanted her son to have friends. kept quiet. She didn't even acknowledge my cookies, though I know she ate them because all that was left on the plate were crumbs. When Margot decided to go to college in Scotland, it felt like a betrayal. Even though I knew it was coming, because of course she was going to go to college somewhere far away. And of course she was going to go to college in Scotland and study anthropology, because she is Margot, the girl with the maps and the travel books and the plans. Of course she would leave us one day. I'm still mad at her, just a little. Just a teeny-tiny bit. Obviously I know it's not her fault. But she's going so far away, and we always said we'd be the Song girls forever. Margot first, me in the middle, and my sister Kitty last. On her birth certificate she is Katherine; to us she is Kitty. Occasionally we call her Kitten, because that's what I called her when she was born: she looked like a scrawny, hairless kitten. I was probably the first kid ever excited for summer to be over. There was too much free time that summer, which can lead to too much thinking; especially for a loss-tricken eleven-year-old. I couldn't wait for seventh grade to start. Todivide into schoolwork. To distract myself from the loneliest facts. At one point, I regretted turning down Dad's offer to spend the summer in Ireland with Mom's family. But I knew that if I went, there would be reminders of her everywhere. Not like there wasn't one every time I looked in the mirror. So the only escape I had was school. When I got the message that I was to report to the main office before class, I was worried I'd be faced with another year of forced visits with the school counselor, looks of pity from my fellow classmates, and well-meaning but oblivious faculty members who kept telling me it was "important to keep her memory alive". Like I could ever forget her. I wasn't ready for any additional drama that morning. It was ready the firs day of a new school year since. "Do you want me to go with you, Macallan?" Emily asked after I received my summons to the office. A tight smile on her face gave away the concern she thought she was hiding. She studied me for a second before adjusting my hair clip. I gave her a reassuring smile and kept it on my face as I entered the office. Principal Blaska greeted me with a hug. "Welcome back, Macallan! How was yout summer?" "Great" I lied. We both stares at each other, neither knowing what to say next. "Well, I'm going to need your assistance today with a new student. Meet Levi Rodgers - he's from Los Angeles!" I looked over and saw this boy with long blond hair pulled into a low ponytail. His hair was even longer than mine. He tucked a loose strand behind his ear before he reached out his hand and said, "hey". I had to give him credit - at least he had manners...for a surfer dude. Principal Blaska handed me his schedule. "Could you show him around and take him to his first class?" "Of course" I led Levi out into the hallway and started giving him the five-cent tour. A few friends passed by to say hello, everuone checking out the new guy. Our school was fairly small; the majority of us had been together since fifth grade, if not kindergarten. I stole another glance at him. It was hard to decipher if he was cute. His hair was practically white in places, probably from the sun. His tan made his light hair and pale eyes stick our even more - but this wouldn't be for very long, since in Winsconsin we rarely see the sun past August. Levi had on a checkered button-down paired with long cargo shorts and flip-flops. It was as if he couldn't decide whether to dress up or be casual. I luckily had Emily to help me pick out my firs day of school outfit that day: a bright yellow and white striped sundress with a withe cardigan. I was so thankful that I had a girly girl friend like Emily. My dad, as much as he tried, couldn't really hel me out with thing like hair, clothes, and makeup. If left to his own devices, I'd wear jeans, sneakers, and a Green Bay Packets T-shirt every day, and eat pizza for every meal. And Emily was a girl as you could get. She was easily one of the prettiest girls in our class, with long, shiny jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. She also had the best clothes, and I was so glad we were the same size so I could borrow them, although se was alredy way more developed than I was. At least I would have someone to go to once I needed a bra. I couldn't even imagine how awkward that would be for Dad.

I was used to Mudwestern politeness, but here was a woman whod just moved to town and I'd just met, and she was alredy offerind her home to me. And she was doing it out of niceness, not because she knew about the accident. Levi pointed to the button on his bag, his eyebrow arching in a playful manner. I imagined us watching Buggy and Floyd together. I do, I mouthed back. The two adults echanged phone numbers.

I gave her a reassuring smile and kept it on my face as I entered the office. Principal Blaska greeted me with a hug. "Welcome back, Macallan! How was yout summer?" "Great" I lied. But it's true that I've never flown by myself before. And also I've never even left the country before. Would Margot meet me at the airport, or would I have to find my own way to the hostel? Josh must see the sudden worry on my face because he says, "Don't worry. Your dad will definitely let you go if I'm with you." It's later that night; Josh is long gone. Kitty and our dad are asleep. We are in the kitchen. Margot is at the table on her computer; I am sitting next to her, rolling cookie dough into balls and dropping them in cinnamon and sugar. Snickerdoodles to get back in Kitty's good graces. Earlier, when I went in to say good night, Kitty rolled over and wouldn't speak to me because she's still convinced I'm going to try to cut her out of the Paris trip. My plan is to put the snickerdoodles on a plate right next to her pillow so she wakes up to the smell of fresh-baked cookies. Margot rolls her eyes at this. She thinks I'm being dramatic, but I'm not. It's true-that's how much Josh loves Margot. He would never so much as look at another girl. "What?" For a moment I forget all about Josh. Because no matter what I am doing in life, if Margot and I are in the middle of an argument, if I am about to get hit by a car, I will always stop and listen to a story about Mommy. Any detail, any remembrance that Margot has, I want to have it too. I'm better off than Kitty, though. Kitty doesn't have one memory of Mommy that we haven't given her. We've told her so many stories so many times that they're hers now. "Remember that time ... ," she'll say. And then she'll tell the story like she was there and not just a little baby. I wave a spoonful of cookie dough under Margot's nose, and she hesitates and then opens her mouth. I feed it to her like a baby. "Wait and see, you and Josh will be back together in a day, maybe two." But even as I'm saying it, I know it's not true. Margot's not the kind of girl to break up and get back together on a whim; once she's decided something, that's it. There's no waffling, no regrets. It's like she said: when she's done, she's just done. I wish and this is a thought I've had many, many times, too many times to count I was more like Margot. Because sometimes it feels like I'll never be done. THE NEXT MORNING, MARGOT IS making coffee and I am pouring cereal in bowls, and I say the thing I've been thinking all morning. "Just so you know, Daddy and Kitty are going to be really upset." When Kitty and I were brushing our teeth just now, I was tempted to go ahead and spill the beans, but Kitty was still mad at me from yesterday, so I kept quiet. She didn't even acknowledge my cookies, though I know she ate them because all that was left on the plate were crumbs. When Margot decided to go to college in Scotland, it felt like a betrayal. Even though I knew it was coming, because of course she was going to go to college somewhere far away. And of course she was going to go to college in Scotland and study anthropology, because she is Margot, the girl with the maps and the travel books and the plans.

She also had the best clothes, and I was so glad we were the same size so I could borrow them, although se was alredy way more developed than I was. At least I would have someone to go to once I needed a bra. I couldn't even imagine how awkward that would be for Dad. For both us.I gave Levu a quick smile, hoping to undo some of the rudeness from the morning. He returned with a sad wave. I paused for a second, and in that second, I notice the look of gratitude on Levi's face. He was expecting me to sit with him or the least invite him over. I hesitated, unsure what to do. I didn't want to play babysister, but I laso knew what it was like be alone. And scared. We talked a little more about summers, and when it was time to go, I made sure Levi knew where he was going next. It was pretty cool to have someone around here who didn't like the same things as everybody else. Uncle Adam was waiting for me after school to take me home. He was always excited to see me, even if he'd dropped me off only a few hours ago. Levi was getting into an SUV with a woman I assumed was his mom. He said something to her and she started to walk over to us. With some reluctance, he followed. A knot began to form tightly in my stomach. I always got defensive whenever anybody met Adam for the first time. I stood there silently for a few seconds. I was used to Mudwestern politeness, but here was a woman whod just moved to town and I'd just met, and she was alredy offerind her home to me. And she was doing it out of niceness, not because she knew about the accident. Levi pointed to the button on his bag, his eyebrow arching in a playful manner. I imagined us watching Buggy and Floyd together. I do, I mouthed back. The two adults echanged phone numbers. The negative me said Levi's mom was doing this because she thought my uncle was unfit to look after me. The positive me said she was a nice person who wanted her son to have friends. kept quiet. She didn't even acknowledge my cookies, though I know she ate them because all that was left on the plate were crumbs. When Margot decided to go to college in Scotland, it felt like a betrayal. Even though I knew it was coming, because of course she was going to go to college somewhere far away. And of course she was going to go to college in Scotland and study anthropology, because she is Margot, the girl with the maps and the travel books and the plans. Of course she would leave us one day. I'm still mad at her, just a little. Just a teeny-tiny bit. Obviously I know it's not her fault. But she's going so far away, and we always said we'd be the Song girls forever. Margot first, me in the middle, and my sister Kitty last. On her birth certificate she is Katherine; to us she is Kitty. Occasionally we call her Kitten, because that's what I called her when she was born: she looked like a scrawny, hairless kitten. I was probably the first kid ever excited for summer to be over. There was too much free time that summer, which can lead to too much thinking; especially for a loss-tricken eleven-year-old. I couldn't wait for seventh grade to start. Todivide into schoolwork. To distract myself from the loneliest facts. At one point, I regretted turning down Dad's offer to spend the summer in Ireland with Mom's family. But I knew that if I went, there would be reminders of her everywhere. Not like there wasn't one every time I looked in the mirror. So the only escape I had was school. When I got the message that I was to report to the main office before class, I was worried I'd be faced with another year of forced visits with the school counselor, looks of pity from my fellow classmates, and well-meaning but oblivious faculty members who kept telling me it was "important to keep her memory alive". Like I could ever forget her. I wasn't ready for any additional drama that morning. It was ready the firs day of a new school year since. "Do you want me to go with you, Macallan?" Emily asked after I received my summons to the office. A tight smile on her face gave away the concern she thought she was hiding. She studied me for a second before adjusting my hair clip. I gave her a reassuring smile and kept it on my face as I entered the office. Principal Blaska greeted me with a hug. "Welcome back, Macallan! How was yout summer?" "Great" I lied. We both stares at each other, neither knowing what to say next. "Well, I'm going to need your assistance today with a new student. Meet Levi Rodgers - he's from Los Angeles!" I looked over and saw this boy with long blond hair pulled into a low ponytail. His hair was even longer than mine. He tucked a loose strand behind his ear before he reached out his hand and said, "hey". I had to give him credit - at least he had manners...for a surfer dude. Principal Blaska handed me his schedule. "Could you show him around and take him to his first class?" "Of course" I led Levi out into the hallway and started giving him the five-cent tour. A few friends passed by to say hello, everuone checking out the new guy. Our school was fairly small; the majority of us had been together since fifth grade, if not kindergarten. I stole another glance at him. It was hard to decipher if he was cute. His hair was practically white in places, probably from the sun. His tan made his light hair and pale eyes stick our even more - but this wouldn't be for very long, since in Winsconsin we rarely see the sun past August. Levi had on a checkered button-down paired with long cargo shorts and flip-flops. It was as if he couldn't decide whether to dress up or be casual. I luckily had Emily to help me pick out my firs day of school outfit that day: a bright yellow and white striped sundress with a withe cardigan. I was so thankful that I had a girly girl friend like Emily. My dad, as much as he tried, couldn't really hel me out with thing like hair, clothes, and makeup. If left to his own devices, I'd wear jeans, sneakers, and a Green Bay Packets T-shirt every day, and eat pizza for every meal. And Emily was a girl as you could get.

She didn't even acknowledge my cookies, though I know she ate them because all that was left on the plate were crumbs. When Margot decided to go to college in Scotland, it felt like a betrayal. Even though I knew it was coming, because of course she was going to go to college somewhere far away. And of course she was going to go to college in Scotland and study anthropology, because she is Margot, the girl with the maps and the travel books and the plans. Of course she would leave us one day. I'm still mad at her, just a little. Just a teeny-tiny bit. Obviously I know it's not her fault. But she's going so far away, and we always said we'd be the Song girls forever. Margot first, me in the middle, and my sister Kitty last. On her birth certificate she is Katherine; to us she is Kitty. Occasionally we call her Kitten, because that's what I called her when she was born: she looked like a scrawny, hairless kitten. I was probably the first kid ever excited for summer to be over. There was too much free time that summer, which can lead to too much thinking; especially for a loss-tricken eleven-year-old. I couldn't wait for seventh grade to start. Todivide into schoolwork. To distract myself from the loneliest facts. At one point, I regretted turning down Dad's offer to spend the summer in Ireland with Mom's family. But I knew that if I went, there would be reminders of her everywhere. Not like there wasn't one every time I looked in the mirror. So the only escape I had was school. When I got the message that I was to report to the main office before class, I was worried I'd be faced with another year of forced visits with the school counselor, looks of pity from my fellow classmates, and well-meaning but oblivious faculty members who kept telling me it was "important to keep her memory alive". Like I could ever forget her. I wasn't ready for any additional drama that morning. It was ready the firs day of a new school year since. "Do you want me to go with you, Macallan?" Emily asked after I received my summons to the office. A tight smile on her face gave away the concern she thought she was hiding. She studied me for a second before adjusting my hair clip. I gave her a reassuring smile and kept it on my face as I entered the office. Principal Blaska greeted me with a hug. "Welcome back, Macallan! How was yout summer?" "Great" I lied. We both stares at each other, neither knowing what to say next. "Well, I'm going to need your assistance today with a new student. Meet Levi Rodgers - he's from Los Angeles!" I looked over and saw this boy with long blond hair pulled into a low ponytail. His hair was even longer than mine. He tucked a loose strand behind his ear before he reached out his hand and said, "hey". I had to give him credit - at least he had manners...for a surfer dude. Principal Blaska handed me his schedule. "Could you show him around and take him to his first class?" "Of course" I led Levi out into the hallway and started giving him the five-cent tour. A few friends passed by to say hello, everuone checking out the new guy. Our school was fairly small; the majority of us had been together since fifth grade, if not kindergarten. I stole another glance at him. It was hard to decipher if he was cute. His hair was practically white in places, probably from the sun. His tan made his light hair and pale eyes stick our even more - but this wouldn't be for very long, since in Winsconsin we rarely see the sun past August. Levi had on a checkered button-down paired with long cargo shorts and flip-flops. It was as if he couldn't decide whether to dress up or be casual. I luckily had Emily to help me pick out my firs day of school outfit that day: a bright yellow and white striped sundress with a withe cardigan. I was so thankful that I had a girly girl friend like Emily. My dad, as much as he tried, couldn't really hel me out with thing like hair, clothes, and makeup. If left to his own devices, I'd wear jeans, sneakers, and a Green Bay Packets T-shirt every day, and eat pizza for every meal. And Emily was a girl as you could get. She was easily one of the prettiest girls in our class, with long, shiny jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. She also had the best clothes, and I was so glad we were the same size so I could borrow them, although se was alredy way more developed than I was. At least I would have someone to go to once I needed a bra. I couldn't even imagine how awkward that would be for Dad. For both us.I gave Levu a quick smile, hoping to undo some of the rudeness from the morning. He returned with a sad wave. I paused for a second, and in that second, I notice the look of gratitude on Levi's face. He was expecting me to sit with him or the least invite him over. I hesitated, unsure what to do. I didn't want to play babysister, but I laso knew what it was like be alone. And scared. We talked a little more about summers, and when it was time to go, I made sure Levi knew where he was going next. It was pretty cool to have someone around here who didn't like the same things as everybody else. Uncle Adam was waiting for me after school to take me home. He was always excited to see me, even if he'd dropped me off only a few hours ago. Levi was getting into an SUV with a woman I assumed was his mom. He said something to her and she started to walk over to us. With some reluctance, he followed. A knot began to form tightly in my stomach. I always got defensive whenever anybody met Adam for the first time. I stood there silently for a few seconds. I was used to Mudwestern politeness, but here was a woman whod just moved to town and I'd just met, and she was alredy offerind her home to me. And she was doing it out of niceness, not because she knew about the accident. Levi pointed to the button on his bag, his eyebrow arching in a playful manner. I imagined us watching Buggy and Floyd together. I do, I mouthed back. The two adults echanged phone numbers.

He was always excited to see me, even if he'd dropped me off only a few hours ago. Levi was getting into an SUV with a woman I assumed was his mom. He said something to her and she started to walk over to us. With some reluctance, he followed. A knot began to form tightly in my stomach. I always got defensive whenever anybody met Adam for the first time. I stood there silently for a few seconds. I was used to Mudwestern politeness, but here was a woman whod just moved to town and I'd just met, and she was alredy offerind her home to me. And she was doing it out of niceness, not because she knew about the accident. Levi pointed to the button on his bag, his eyebrow arching in a playful manner. I imagined us watching Buggy and Floyd together. I do, I mouthed back. The two adults echanged phone numbers. The negative me said Levi's mom was doing this because she thought my uncle was unfit to look after me. The positive me said she was a nice person who wanted her son to have friends. kept quiet. She didn't even acknowledge my cookies, though I know she ate them because all that was left on the plate were crumbs. When Margot decided to go to college in Scotland, it felt like a betrayal. Even though I knew it was coming, because of course she was going to go to college somewhere far away. And of course she was going to go to college in Scotland and study anthropology, because she is Margot, the girl with the maps and the travel books and the plans. Of course she would leave us one day. I'm still mad at her, just a little. Just a teeny-tiny bit. Obviously I know it's not her fault. But she's going so far away, and we always said we'd be the Song girls forever. Margot first, me in the middle, and my sister Kitty last. On her birth certificate she is Katherine; to us she is Kitty. Occasionally we call her Kitten, because that's what I called her when she was born: she looked like a scrawny, hairless kitten. I was probably the first kid ever excited for summer to be over. There was too much free time that summer, which can lead to too much thinking; especially for a loss-tricken eleven-year-old. I couldn't wait for seventh grade to start. Todivide into schoolwork. To distract myself from the loneliest facts. At one point, I regretted turning down Dad's offer to spend the summer in Ireland with Mom's family. But I knew that if I went, there would be reminders of her everywhere. Not like there wasn't one every time I looked in the mirror. So the only escape I had was school. When I got the message that I was to report to the main office before class, I was worried I'd be faced with another year of forced visits with the school counselor, looks of pity from my fellow classmates, and well-meaning but oblivious faculty members who kept telling me it was "important to keep her memory alive". Like I could ever forget her. I wasn't ready for any additional drama that morning. It was ready the firs day of a new school year since. "Do you want me to go with you, Macallan?" Emily asked after I received my summons to the office. A tight smile on her face gave away the concern she thought she was hiding. She studied me for a second before adjusting my hair clip. I gave her a reassuring smile and kept it on my face as I entered the office. Principal Blaska greeted me with a hug. "Welcome back, Macallan! How was yout summer?" "Great" I lied. We both stares at each other, neither knowing what to say next. "Well, I'm going to need your assistance today with a new student. Meet Levi Rodgers - he's from Los Angeles!" I looked over and saw this boy with long blond hair pulled into a low ponytail. His hair was even longer than mine. He tucked a loose strand behind his ear before he reached out his hand and said, "hey". I had to give him credit - at least he had manners...for a surfer dude. Principal Blaska handed me his schedule. "Could you show him around and take him to his first class?" "Of course" I led Levi out into the hallway and started giving him the five-cent tour. A few friends passed by to say hello, everuone checking out the new guy. Our school was fairly small; the majority of us had been together since fifth grade, if not kindergarten. I stole another glance at him. It was hard to decipher if he was cute. His hair was practically white in places, probably from the sun. His tan made his light hair and pale eyes stick our even more - but this wouldn't be for very long, since in Winsconsin we rarely see the sun past August. Levi had on a checkered button-down paired with long cargo shorts and flip-flops. It was as if he couldn't decide whether to dress up or be casual. I luckily had Emily to help me pick out my firs day of school outfit that day: a bright yellow and white striped sundress with a withe cardigan. I was so thankful that I had a girly girl friend like Emily. My dad, as much as he tried, couldn't really hel me out with thing like hair, clothes, and makeup. If left to his own devices, I'd wear jeans, sneakers, and a Green Bay Packets T-shirt every day, and eat pizza for every meal. And Emily was a girl as you could get. She was easily one of the prettiest girls in our class, with long, shiny jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. She also had the best clothes, and I was so glad we were the same size so I could borrow them, although se was alredy way more developed than I was. At least I would have someone to go to once I needed a bra. I couldn't even imagine how awkward that would be for Dad. For both us.I gave Levu a quick smile, hoping to undo some of the rudeness from the morning. He returned with a sad wave. I paused for a second, and in that second, I notice the look of gratitude on Levi's face. He was expecting me to sit with him or the least invite him over. I hesitated, unsure what to do. I didn't want to play babysister, but I laso knew what it was like be alone. And scared. We talked a little more about summers, and when it was time to go, I made sure Levi knew where he was going next.

She didn't even acknowledge my cookies, though I know she ate them because all that was left on the plate were crumbs. When Margot decided to go to college in Scotland, it felt like a betrayal. Even though I knew it was coming, because of course she was going to go to college somewhere far away. And of course she was going to go to college in Scotland and study anthropology, because she is Margot, the girl with the maps and the travel books and the plans. Of course she would leave us one day. I'm still mad at her, just a little. Just a teeny-tiny bit. Obviously I know it's not her fault. But she's going so far away, and we always said we'd be the Song girls forever. Margot first, me in the middle, and my sister Kitty last. On her birth certificate she is Katherine; to us she is Kitty. Occasionally we call her Kitten, because that's what I called her when she was born: she looked like a scrawny, hairless kitten. I was probably the first kid ever excited for summer to be over. There was too much free time that summer, which can lead to too much thinking; especially for a loss-tricken eleven-year-old. I couldn't wait for seventh grade to start. Todivide into schoolwork. To distract myself from the loneliest facts. At one point, I regretted turning down Dad's offer to spend the summer in Ireland with Mom's family. But I knew that if I went, there would be reminders of her everywhere. Not like there wasn't one every time I looked in the mirror. So the only escape I had was school. When I got the message that I was to report to the main office before class, I was worried I'd be faced with another year of forced visits with the school counselor, looks of pity from my fellow classmates, and well-meaning but oblivious faculty members who kept telling me it was "important to keep her memory alive". Like I could ever forget her. I wasn't ready for any additional drama that morning. It was ready the firs day of a new school year since. "Do you want me to go with you, Macallan?" Emily asked after I received my summons to the office. A tight smile on her face gave away the concern she thought she was hiding. She studied me for a second before adjusting my hair clip. I gave her a reassuring smile and kept it on my face as I entered the office. Principal Blaska greeted me with a hug. "Welcome back, Macallan! How was yout summer?" "Great" I lied. We both stares at each other, neither knowing what to say next. "Well, I'm going to need your assistance today with a new student. Meet Levi Rodgers - he's from Los Angeles!" I looked over and saw this boy with long blond hair pulled into a low ponytail. His hair was even longer than mine. He tucked a loose strand behind his ear before he reached out his hand and said, "hey". I had to give him credit - at least he had manners...for a surfer dude. Principal Blaska handed me his schedule. "Could you show him around and take him to his first class?" "Of course" I led Levi out into the hallway and started giving him the five-cent tour. A few friends passed by to say hello, everuone checking out the new guy. Our school was fairly small; the majority of us had been together since fifth grade, if not kindergarten. I stole another glance at him. It was hard to decipher if he was cute. His hair was practically white in places, probably from the sun. His tan made his light hair and pale eyes stick our even more - but this wouldn't be for very long, since in Winsconsin we rarely see the sun past August. Levi had on a checkered button-down paired with long cargo shorts and flip-flops. It was as if he couldn't decide whether to dress up or be casual. I luckily had Emily to help me pick out my firs day of school outfit that day: a bright yellow and white striped sundress with a withe cardigan. I was so thankful that I had a girly girl friend like Emily. My dad, as much as he tried, couldn't really hel me out with thing like hair, clothes, and makeup. If left to his own devices, I'd wear jeans, sneakers, and a Green Bay Packets T-shirt every day, and eat pizza for every meal. And Emily was a girl as you could get. She was easily one of the prettiest girls in our class, with long, shiny jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. She also had the best clothes, and I was so glad we were the same size so I could borrow them, although se was alredy way more developed than I was. At least I would have someone to go to once I needed a bra. I couldn't even imagine how awkward that would be for Dad. For both us.I gave Levu a quick smile, hoping to undo some of the rudeness from the morning. He returned with a sad wave. I paused for a second, and in that second, I notice the look of gratitude on Levi's face. He was expecting me to sit with him or the least invite him over. I hesitated, unsure what to do. I didn't want to play babysister, but I laso knew what it was like be alone. And scared. We talked a little more about summers, and when it was time to go, I made sure Levi knew where he was going next. It was pretty cool to have someone around here who didn't like the same things as everybody else. Uncle Adam was waiting for me after school to take me home. He was always excited to see me, even if he'd dropped me off only a few hours ago. Levi was getting into an SUV with a woman I assumed was his mom. He said something to her and she started to walk over to us. With some reluctance, he followed. A knot began to form tightly in my stomach. I always got defensive whenever anybody met Adam for the first time. I stood there silently for a few seconds. I was used to Mudwestern politeness, but here was a woman whod just moved to town and I'd just met, and she was alredy offerind her home to me. And she was doing it out of niceness, not because she knew about the accident. Levi pointed to the button on his bag, his eyebrow arching in a playful manner. JOSH IS MARGOT'S BOYFRIEND, BUT I guess you could say my whole family is a little in love with him. It's hard to say who most of all. Before he was Margot's boyfriend, he was just Josh. He was always there. I say always, but I guess that's not true. He moved next door five years ago but it feels like always. My dad loves Josh because he's a boy and my dad is surrounded by girls. I mean it all day long he is surrounded by females. My dad is an ob-gyn, and he also happens to be the father of three daughters, so it's like girls, girls, girls all day. He also likes Josh because Josh likes comics and he'll go fishing with him. My dad tried to take us fishing once, and I cried when my shoes got mud on them, and Margot cried when her book got wet, and Kitty cried because Kitty was still practically a baby. Kitty loves Josh because he'll play cards with her and not get bored. Or at least pretend to not get bored. They make deals with each other-if I win this next hand, you have to make me a toasted crunchy-peanut-butter-sandwich, no crusts. That's Kitty. Inevitably there won't be crunchy peanut butter and Josh will say too bad, pick something else. But then Kitty will wear him down and he'll run out and buy some, because that's Josh. If I had to say why Margot loves him, I think maybe I would say it's because we all do. We are in the living room, Kitty is pasting pictures of dogs to a giant piece of cardboard. There's paper and scraps all around her. Humming to herself, she says, "When Daddy asks me what I want for Christmas, I am just going to say, 'Pick any one of these breeds and we'll be good.'?" Margot and Josh are on the couch; I'm lying on the floor, watching TV. Josh popped a big bowl of popcorn, and I devote myself to it, handfuls and handfuls of it. A commercial comes on for perfume: a girl is running around the streets of Paris in an orchid-colored halter dress that is thin as tissue paper. What I wouldn't give to be that girl in that tissue-paper dress running around Paris in springtime! I sit up so suddenly I choke on a kernel of popcorn. Between coughs I say, "Margot, let's meet in Paris for my spring break!" I'm already picturing myself twirling with a pistachio macaron in one hand and a raspberry one in the other. Margot's eyes light up. "Do you think Daddy will let you?" "Sure, it's culture. He'll have to let me." But it's true that I've never flown by myself before. And also I've never even left the country before. Would Margot meet me at the airport, or would I have to find my own way to the hostel? Josh must see the sudden worry on my face because he says, "Don't worry. Your dad will definitely let you go if I'm with you." It's later that night; Josh is long gone. Kitty and our dad are asleep. We are in the kitchen. Margot is at the table on her computer; I am sitting next to her, rolling cookie dough into balls and dropping them in cinnamon and sugar. Snickerdoodles to get back in Kitty's good graces. Earlier, when I went in to say good night, Kitty rolled over and wouldn't speak to me because she's still convinced I'm going to try to cut her out of the Paris trip. My plan is to put the snickerdoodles on a plate right next to her pillow so she wakes up to the smell of fresh-baked cookies. Margot rolls her eyes at this. She thinks I'm being dramatic, but I'm not. It's true-that's how much Josh loves Margot. He would never so much as look at another girl. "What?" For a moment I forget all about Josh. Because no matter what I am doing in life, if Margot and I are in the middle of an argument, if I am about to get hit by a car, I will always stop and listen to a story about Mommy. Any detail, any remembrance that Margot has, I want to have it too. I'm better off than Kitty, though. Kitty doesn't have one memory of Mommy that we haven't given her. We've told her so many stories so many times that they're hers now. "Remember that time ... ," she'll say. And then she'll tell the story like she was there and not just a little baby. I wave a spoonful of cookie dough under Margot's nose, and she hesitates and then opens her mouth. I feed it to her like a baby. "Wait and see, you and Josh will be back together in a day, maybe two." But even as I'm saying it, I know it's not true. Margot's not the kind of girl to break up and get back together on a whim; once she's decided something, that's it. There's no waffling, no regrets. It's like she said: when she's done, she's just done. I wish and this is a thought I've had many, many times, too many times to count I was more like Margot. Because sometimes it feels like I'll never be done. THE NEXT MORNING, MARGOT IS making coffee and I am pouring cereal in bowls, and I say the thing I've been thinking all morning. "Just so you know, Daddy and Kitty are going to be really upset." When Kitty and I were brushing our teeth just now, I was tempted to go ahead and spill the beans, but Kitty was still mad at me from yesterday, so I kept quiet. She didn't even acknowledge my cookies, though I know she ate them because all that was left on the plate were crumbs. When Margot decided to go to college in Scotland, it felt like a betrayal. Even though I knew it was coming, because of course she was going to go to college somewhere far away.

A few friends passed by to say hello, everuone checking out the new guy. Our school was fairly small; the majority of us had been together since fifth grade, if not kindergarten. I stole another glance at him. It was hard to decipher if he was cute. His hair was practically white in places, probably from the sun. His tan made his light hair and pale eyes stick our even more - but this wouldn't be for very long, since in Winsconsin we rarely see the sun past August. Levi had on a checkered button-down paired with long cargo shorts and flip-flops. It was as if he couldn't decide whether to dress up or be casual. I luckily had Emily to help me pick out my firs day of school outfit that day: a bright yellow and white striped sundress with a withe cardigan. I was so thankful that I had a girly girl friend like Emily. My dad, as much as he tried, couldn't really hel me out with thing like hair, clothes, and makeup. If left to his own devices, I'd wear jeans, sneakers, and a Green Bay Packets T-shirt every day, and eat pizza for every meal. And Emily was a girl as you could get. She was easily one of the prettiest girls in our class, with long, shiny jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. She also had the best clothes, and I was so glad we were the same size so I could borrow them, although se was alredy way more developed than I was. At least I would have someone to go to once I needed a bra. I couldn't even imagine how awkward that would be for Dad. For both us.I gave Levu a quick smile, hoping to undo some of the rudeness from the morning. He returned with a sad wave. I paused for a second, and in that second, I notice the look of gratitude on Levi's face. He was expecting me to sit with him or the least invite him over. I hesitated, unsure what to do. I didn't want to play babysister, but I laso knew what it was like be alone. And scared. We talked a little more about summers, and when it was time to go, I made sure Levi knew where he was going next. It was pretty cool to have someone around here who didn't like the same things as everybody else. Uncle Adam was waiting for me after school to take me home. He was always excited to see me, even if he'd dropped me off only a few hours ago. Levi was getting into an SUV with a woman I assumed was his mom. He said something to her and she started to walk over to us. With some reluctance, he followed. A knot began to form tightly in my stomach. I always got defensive whenever anybody met Adam for the first time. I stood there silently for a few seconds. I was used to Mudwestern politeness, but here was a woman whod just moved to town and I'd just met, and she was alredy offerind her home to me. And she was doing it out of niceness, not because she knew about the accident. Levi pointed to the button on his bag, his eyebrow arching in a playful manner. I imagined us watching Buggy and Floyd together. I do, I mouthed back. The two adults echanged phone numbers. The negative me said Levi's mom was doing this because she thought my uncle was unfit to look after me. The positive me said she was a nice person who wanted her son to have friends. kept quiet. She didn't even acknowledge my cookies, though I know she ate them because all that was left on the plate were crumbs. When Margot decided to go to college in Scotland, it felt like a betrayal. Even though I knew it was coming, because of course she was going to go to college somewhere far away. And of course she was going to go to college in Scotland and study anthropology, because she is Margot, the girl with the maps and the travel books and the plans. Of course she would leave us one day. I'm still mad at her, just a little. Just a teeny-tiny bit. Obviously I know it's not her fault. But she's going so far away, and we always said we'd be the Song girls forever. Margot first, me in the middle, and my sister Kitty last. On her birth certificate she is Katherine; to us she is Kitty. Occasionally we call her Kitten, because that's what I called her when she was born: she looked like a scrawny, hairless kitten. I was probably the first kid ever excited for summer to be over. There was too much free time that summer, which can lead to too much thinking; especially for a loss-tricken eleven-year-old. I couldn't wait for seventh grade to start. Todivide into schoolwork. To distract myself from the loneliest facts. At one point, I regretted turning down Dad's offer to spend the summer in Ireland with Mom's family. But I knew that if I went, there would be reminders of her everywhere. Not like there wasn't one every time I looked in the mirror. So the only escape I had was school. When I got the message that I was to report to the main office before class, I was worried I'd be faced with another year of forced visits with the school counselor, looks of pity from my fellow classmates, and well-meaning but oblivious faculty members who kept telling me it was "important to keep her memory alive". Like I could ever forget her. I wasn't ready for any additional drama that morning. It was ready the firs day of a new school year since. "Do you want me to go with you, Macallan?" Emily asked after I received my summons to the office. A tight smile on her face gave away the concern she thought she was hiding. She studied me for a second before adjusting my hair clip. I gave her a reassuring smile and kept it on my face as I entered the office. Principal Blaska greeted me with a hug. "Welcome back, Macallan! How was yout summer?" "Great" I lied. We both stares at each other, neither knowing what to say next. "Well, I'm going to need your assistance today with a new student. Meet Levi Rodgers - he's from Los Angeles!" I looked over and saw this boy with long blond hair pulled into a low ponytail. His hair was even longer than mine. He tucked a loose strand behind his ear before he reached out his hand and said, "hey". I had to give him credit - at least he had manners...for a surfer dude. Principal Blaska handed me his schedule. "Could you show him around and take him to his first class?" "Of course" I led Levi out into the hallway and started giving him the five-cent tour.

It was pretty cool to have someone around here who didn't like the same things as everybody else. Uncle Adam was waiting for me after school to take me home. He was always excited to see me, even if he'd dropped me off only a few hours ago. Levi was getting into an SUV with a woman I assumed was his mom. He said something to her and she started to walk over to us. With some reluctance, he followed. A knot began to form tightly in my stomach. I always got defensive whenever anybody met Adam for the first time. I stood there silently for a few seconds. I was used to Mudwestern politeness, but here was a woman whod just moved to town and I'd just met, and she was alredy offerind her home to me. And she was doing it out of niceness, not because she knew about the accident. Levi pointed to the button on his bag, his eyebrow arching in a playful manner. I imagined us watching Buggy and Floyd together. I do, I mouthed back. The two adults echanged phone numbers. The negative me said Levi's mom was doing this because she thought my uncle was unfit to look after me. The positive me said she was a nice person who wanted her son to have friends. kept quiet. She didn't even acknowledge my cookies, though I know she ate them because all that was left on the plate were crumbs. When Margot decided to go to college in Scotland, it felt like a betrayal. Even though I knew it was coming, because of course she was going to go to college somewhere far away. And of course she was going to go to college in Scotland and study anthropology, because she is Margot, the girl with the maps and the travel books and the plans. Of course she would leave us one day. I'm still mad at her, just a little. Just a teeny-tiny bit. Obviously I know it's not her fault. But she's going so far away, and we always said we'd be the Song girls forever. Margot first, me in the middle, and my sister Kitty last. On her birth certificate she is Katherine; to us she is Kitty. Occasionally we call her Kitten, because that's what I called her when she was born: she looked like a scrawny, hairless kitten. I was probably the first kid ever excited for summer to be over. There was too much free time that summer, which can lead to too much thinking; especially for a loss-tricken eleven-year-old. I couldn't wait for seventh grade to start. Todivide into schoolwork. To distract myself from the loneliest facts. At one point, I regretted turning down Dad's offer to spend the summer in Ireland with Mom's family. But I knew that if I went, there would be reminders of her everywhere. Not like there wasn't one every time I looked in the mirror. So the only escape I had was school. When I got the message that I was to report to the main office before class, I was worried I'd be faced with another year of forced visits with the school counselor, looks of pity from my fellow classmates, and well-meaning but oblivious faculty members who kept telling me it was "important to keep her memory alive". Like I could ever forget her. I wasn't ready for any additional drama that morning. It was ready the firs day of a new school year since. "Do you want me to go with you, Macallan?" Emily asked after I received my summons to the office. A tight smile on her face gave away the concern she thought she was hiding. She studied me for a second before adjusting my hair clip. I gave her a reassuring smile and kept it on my face as I entered the office. Principal Blaska greeted me with a hug. "Welcome back, Macallan! How was yout summer?" "Great" I lied. We both stares at each other, neither knowing what to say next. "Well, I'm going to need your assistance today with a new student. Meet Levi Rodgers - he's from Los Angeles!" I looked over and saw this boy with long blond hair pulled into a low ponytail. His hair was even longer than mine. He tucked a loose strand behind his ear before he reached out his hand and said, "hey". I had to give him credit - at least he had manners...for a surfer dude. Principal Blaska handed me his schedule. "Could you show him around and take him to his first class?" "Of course" I led Levi out into the hallway and started giving him the five-cent tour. A few friends passed by to say hello, everuone checking out the new guy. Our school was fairly small; the majority of us had been together since fifth grade, if not kindergarten. I stole another glance at him. It was hard to decipher if he was cute. His hair was practically white in places, probably from the sun. His tan made his light hair and pale eyes stick our even more - but this wouldn't be for very long, since in Winsconsin we rarely see the sun past August. Levi had on a checkered button-down paired with long cargo shorts and flip-flops. It was as if he couldn't decide whether to dress up or be casual. I luckily had Emily to help me pick out my firs day of school outfit that day: a bright yellow and white striped sundress with a withe cardigan. I was so thankful that I had a girly girl friend like Emily. My dad, as much as he tried, couldn't really hel me out with thing like hair, clothes, and makeup. If left to his own devices, I'd wear jeans, sneakers, and a Green Bay Packets T-shirt every day, and eat pizza for every meal. And Emily was a girl as you could get. She was easily one of the prettiest girls in our class, with long, shiny jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. She also had the best clothes, and I was so glad we were the same size so I could borrow them, although se was alredy way more developed than I was. At least I would have someone to go to once I needed a bra. I couldn't even imagine how awkward that would be for Dad. For both us.I gave Levu a quick smile, hoping to undo some of the rudeness from the morning. He returned with a sad wave. I paused for a second, and in that second, I notice the look of gratitude on Levi's face. He was expecting me to sit with him or the least invite him over. I hesitated, unsure what to do. I didn't want to play babysister, but I laso knew what it was like be alone. And scared.

I was probably the first kid ever excited for summer to be over. There was too much free time that summer, which can lead to too much thinking; especially for a loss-tricken eleven-year-old. I couldn't wait for seventh grade to start. Todivide into schoolwork. To distract myself from the loneliest facts. At one point, I regretted turning down Dad's offer to spend the summer in Ireland with Mom's family. But I knew that if I went, there would be reminders of her everywhere. Not like there wasn't one every time I looked in the mirror. So the only escape I had was school. When I got the message that I was to report to the main office before class, I was worried I'd be faced with another year of forced visits with the school counselor, looks of pity from my fellow classmates, and well-meaning but oblivious faculty members who kept telling me it was "important to keep her memory alive". Like I could ever forget her. I wasn't ready for any additional drama that morning. It was ready the firs day of a new school year since. "Do you want me to go with you, Macallan?" Emily asked after I received my summons to the office. A tight smile on her face gave away the concern she thought she was hiding. She studied me for a second before adjusting my hair clip. I gave her a reassuring smile and kept it on my face as I entered the office. Principal Blaska greeted me with a hug. "Welcome back, Macallan! How was yout summer?" "Great" I lied. We both stares at each other, neither knowing what to say next. "Well, I'm going to need your assistance today with a new student. Meet Levi Rodgers - he's from Los Angeles!" I looked over and saw this boy with long blond hair pulled into a low ponytail. His hair was even longer than mine. He tucked a loose strand behind his ear before he reached out his hand and said, "hey". I had to give him credit - at least he had manners...for a surfer dude. Principal Blaska handed me his schedule. "Could you show him around and take him to his first class?" "Of course" I led Levi out into the hallway and started giving him the five-cent tour. A few friends passed by to say hello, everuone checking out the new guy. Our school was fairly small; the majority of us had been together since fifth grade, if not kindergarten. I stole another glance at him. It was hard to decipher if he was cute. His hair was practically white in places, probably from the sun. His tan made his light hair and pale eyes stick our even more - but this wouldn't be for very long, since in Winsconsin we rarely see the sun past August. Levi had on a checkered button-down paired with long cargo shorts and flip-flops. It was as if he couldn't decide whether to dress up or be casual. I luckily had Emily to help me pick out my firs day of school outfit that day: a bright yellow and white striped sundress with a withe cardigan. I was so thankful that I had a girly girl friend like Emily. My dad, as much as he tried, couldn't really hel me out with thing like hair, clothes, and makeup. If left to his own devices, I'd wear jeans, sneakers, and a Green Bay Packets T-shirt every day, and eat pizza for every meal. And Emily was a girl as you could get. She was easily one of the prettiest girls in our class, with long, shiny jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. She also had the best clothes, and I was so glad we were the same size so I could borrow them, although se was alredy way more developed than I was. At least I would have someone to go to once I needed a bra. I couldn't even imagine how awkward that would be for Dad. For both us.I gave Levu a quick smile, hoping to undo some of the rudeness from the morning. He returned with a sad wave. I paused for a second, and in that second, I notice the look of gratitude on Levi's face. He was expecting me to sit with him or the least invite him over. I hesitated, unsure what to do. I didn't want to play babysister, but I laso knew what it was like be alone. And scared. We talked a little more about summers, and when it was time to go, I made sure Levi knew where he was going next. It was pretty cool to have someone around here who didn't like the same things as everybody else. Uncle Adam was waiting for me after school to take me home. He was always excited to see me, even if he'd dropped me off only a few hours ago. Levi was getting into an SUV with a woman I assumed was his mom. He said something to her and she started to walk over to us. With some reluctance, he followed. A knot began to form tightly in my stomach. I always got defensive whenever anybody met Adam for the first time. I stood there silently for a few seconds. I was used to Mudwestern politeness, but here was a woman whod just moved to town and I'd just met, and she was alredy offerind her home to me. And she was doing it out of niceness, not because she knew about the accident. Levi pointed to the button on his bag, his eyebrow arching in a playful manner. I imagined us watching Buggy and Floyd together. I do, I mouthed back. The two adults echanged phone numbers. The negative me said Levi's mom was doing this because she thought my uncle was unfit to look after me. The positive me said she was a nice person who wanted her son to have friends. kept quiet. She didn't even acknowledge my cookies, though I know she ate them because all that was left on the plate were crumbs. When Margot decided to go to college in Scotland, it felt like a betrayal. Even though I knew it was coming, because of course she was going to go to college somewhere far away. And of course she was going to go to college in Scotland and study anthropology, because she is Margot, the girl with the maps and the travel books and the plans. Of course she would leave us one day. I'm still mad at her, just a little. Just a teeny-tiny bit. Obviously I know it's not her fault. But she's going so far away, and we always said we'd be the Song girls forever. Margot first, me in the middle, and my sister Kitty last.

A Fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree. The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them. The bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it. The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. Again and again he tried, but in vain. Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust. What a fool I am, he said. Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for. And off he walked very, very scornfully. Moral of the fable: There are many who pretend to despise and belittle that which is beyond their reach. A Wolf found great difficulty in getting at the sheep owing to the vigilance of the shepherd and his dogs. But one day it found the skin of a sheep that had been flayed and thrown aside, so it put it on over its own pelt and strolled down among the sheep. The Lamb that belonged to the sheep, whose skin the Wolf was wearing, began to follow the Wolf in the Sheep's clothing; so, leading the Lamb a little apart, he soon made a meal off her, and for some time he succeeded in deceiving the sheep, and enjoying hearty meals. JOSH IS MARGOT'S BOYFRIEND, BUT I guess you could say my whole family is a little in love with him. It's hard to say who most of all. Before he was Margot's boyfriend, he was just Josh. He was always there. I say always, but I guess that's not true. He moved next door five years ago but it feels like always. My dad loves Josh because he's a boy and my dad is surrounded by girls. I mean it all day long he is surrounded by females. My dad is an ob-gyn, and he also happens to be the father of three daughters, so it's like girls, girls, girls all day. He also likes Josh because Josh likes comics and he'll go fishing with him. My dad tried to take us fishing once, and I cried when my shoes got mud on them, and Margot cried when her book got wet, and Kitty cried because Kitty was still practically a baby. Kitty loves Josh because he'll play cards with her and not get bored. Or at least pretend to not get bored. They make deals with each other-if I win this next hand, you have to make me a toasted crunchy-peanut-butter-sandwich, no crusts. That's Kitty. Inevitably there won't be crunchy peanut butter and Josh will say too bad, pick something else. But then Kitty will wear him down and he'll run out and buy some, because that's Josh. If I had to say why Margot loves him, I think maybe I would say it's because we all do. We are in the living room, Kitty is pasting pictures of dogs to a giant piece of cardboard. There's paper and scraps all around her. Humming to herself, she says, "When Daddy asks me what I want for Christmas, I am just going to say, 'Pick any one of these breeds and we'll be good.'?" Margot and Josh are on the couch; I'm lying on the floor, watching TV. Josh popped a big bowl of popcorn, and I devote myself to it, handfuls and handfuls of it. A commercial comes on for perfume: a girl is running around the streets of Paris in an orchid-colored halter dress that is thin as tissue paper. What I wouldn't give to be that girl in that tissue-paper dress running around Paris in springtime! I sit up so suddenly I choke on a kernel of popcorn. Between coughs I say, "Margot, let's meet in Paris for my spring break!" I'm already picturing myself twirling with a pistachio macaron in one hand and a raspberry one in the other. Margot's eyes light up. "Do you think Daddy will let you?" "Sure, it's culture. He'll have to let me." But it's true that I've never flown by myself before. And also I've never even left the country before. Would Margot meet me at the airport, or would I have to find my own way to the hostel? Josh must see the sudden worry on my face because he says, "Don't worry. Your dad will definitely let you go if I'm with you." It's later that night; Josh is long gone. Kitty and our dad are asleep. We are in the kitchen. Margot is at the table on her computer; I am sitting next to her, rolling cookie dough into balls and dropping them in cinnamon and sugar. Snickerdoodles to get back in Kitty's good graces. Earlier, when I went in to say good night, Kitty rolled over and wouldn't speak to me because she's still convinced I'm going to try to cut her out of the Paris trip. My plan is to put the snickerdoodles on a plate right next to her pillow so she wakes up to the smell of fresh-baked cookies. Margot rolls her eyes at this. She thinks I'm being dramatic, but I'm not. It's true-that's how much Josh loves Margot. He would never so much as look at another girl. "What?" For a moment I forget all about Josh. Because no matter what I am doing in life, if Margot and I are in the middle of an argument, if I am about to get hit by a car, I will always stop and listen to a story about Mommy. Any detail, any remembrance that Margot has, I want to have it too. I'm better off than Kitty, though. Kitty doesn't have one memory of Mommy that we haven't given her. We've told her so many stories so many times that they're hers now. "Remember that time ... ," she'll say. And then she'll tell the story like she was there and not just a little baby. I wave a spoonful of cookie dough under Margot's nose, and she hesitates and then opens her mouth. I feed it to her like a baby. "Wait and see, you and Josh will be back together in a day, maybe two." But even as I'm saying it, I know it's not true. Margot's not the kind of girl to break up and get back together on a whim; once she's decided something, that's it. There's no waffling, no regrets. It's like she said: when she's done, she's just done. I wish and this is a thought I've had many, many times, too many times to count I was more like Margot. Because sometimes it feels like I'll never be done. THE NEXT MORNING, MARGOT IS making coffee and I am pouring cereal in bowls, and I say the thing I've been thinking all morning. "Just so you know, Daddy and Kitty are going to be really upset." When Kitty and I were brushing our teeth just now, I was tempted to go ahead and spill the beans, but Kitty was still mad at me from yesterday, so I kept quiet. She didn't even acknowledge my cookies, though I know she ate them because all that was left on the plate were crumbs. When Margot decided to go to college in Scotland, it felt like a betrayal. Even though I knew it was coming, because of course she was going to go to college somewhere far away. And of course she was going to go to college in Scotland and study anthropology, because she is Margot, the girl with the maps and the travel books and the plans. Of course she would leave us one day. I'm still mad at her, just a little. Just a teeny-tiny bit. Obviously I know it's not her fault. But she's going so far away, and we always said we'd be the Song girls forever. Margot first, me in the middle, and my sister Kitty last. On her birth certificate she is Katherine; to us she is Kitty. Occasionally we call her Kitten, because that's what I called her when she was born: she looked like a scrawny, hairless kitten. I was probably the first kid ever excited for summer to be over. There was too much free time that summer, which can lead to too much thinking; especially for a loss-tricken eleven-year-old. I couldn't wait for seventh grade to start. Todivide into schoolwork. To distract myself from the loneliest facts. At one point, I regretted turning down Dad's offer to spend the summer in Ireland with Mom's family. But I knew that if I went, there would be reminders of her everywhere. Not like there wasn't one every time I looked in the mirror. So the only escape I had was school. When I got the message that I was to report to the main office before class, I was worried I'd be faced with another year of forced visits with the school counselor, looks of pity from my fellow classmates, and well-meaning but oblivious faculty members who kept telling me it was "important to keep her memory alive". Like I could ever forget her. I wasn't ready for any additional drama that morning. It was ready the firs day of a new school year since. "Do you want me to go with you, Macallan?" Emily asked after I received my summons to the office. A tight smile on her face gave away the concern she thought she was hiding. She studied me for a second before adjusting my hair clip. I gave her a reassuring smile and kept it on my face as I entered the office. Principal Blaska greeted me with a hug. "Welcome back, Macallan! How was yout summer?" "Great" I lied. We both stares at each other, neither knowing what to say next. "Well, I'm going to need your assistance today with a new student. Meet Levi Rodgers - he's from Los Angeles!" I looked over and saw this boy with long blond hair pulled into a low ponytail. His hair was even longer than mine. He tucked a loose strand behind his ear before he reached out his hand and said, "hey". I had to give him credit - at least he had manners...for a surfer dude. Principal Blaska handed me his schedule. "Could you show him around and take him to his first class?" "Of course" I led Levi out into the hallway and started giving him the five-cent tour. A few friends passed by to say hello, everuone checking out the new guy. Our school was fairly small; the majority of us had been together since fifth grade, if not kindergarten. I stole another glance at him. It was hard to decipher if he was cute. His hair was practically white in places, probably from the sun. His tan made his light hair and pale eyes stick our even more - but this wouldn't be for very long, since in Winsconsin we rarely see the sun past August. Levi had on a checkered button-down paired with long cargo shorts and flip-flops. It was as if he couldn't decide whether to dress up or be casual. I luckily had Emily to help me pick out my firs day of school outfit that day: a bright yellow and white striped sundress with a withe cardigan. I was so thankful that I had a girly girl friend like Emily. My dad, as much as he tried, couldn't really hel me out with thing like hair, clothes, and makeup. If left to his own devices, I'd wear jeans, sneakers, and a Green Bay Packets T-shirt every day, and eat pizza for every meal. And Emily was a girl as you could get. She was easily one of the prettiest girls in our class, with long, shiny jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. She also had the best clothes, and I was so glad we were the same size so I could borrow them, although se was alredy way more developed than I was. At least I would have someone to go to once I needed a bra. I couldn't even imagine how awkward that would be for Dad. For both us.I gave Levu a quick smile, hoping to undo some of the rudeness from the morning. He returned with a sad wave. I paused for a second, and in that second, I notice the look of gratitude on Levi's face. He was expecting me to sit with him or the least invite him over. I hesitated, unsure what to do. I didn't want to play babysister, but I laso knew what it was like be alone. And scared. We talked a little more about summers, and when it was time to go, I made sure Levi knew where he was going next. It was pretty cool to have someone around here who didn't like the same things as everybody else. Uncle Adam was waiting for me after school to take me home. He was always excited to see me, even if he'd dropped me off only a few hours ago. Levi was getting into an SUV with a woman I assumed was his mom. He said something to her and she started to walk over to us. With some reluctance, he followed. A knot began to form tightly in my stomach. I always got defensive whenever anybody met Adam for the first time. I stood there silently for a few seconds. I was used to Mudwestern politeness, but here was a woman whod just moved to town and I'd just met, and she was alredy offerind her home to me. And she was doing it out of niceness, not because she knew about the accident. Levi pointed to the button on his bag, his eyebrow arching in a playful manner. I imagined us watching Buggy and Floyd together. I do, I mouthed back. The two adults echanged phone numbers. The negative me said Levi's mom was doing this because she thought my uncle was unfit to look after me. The positive me said she was a nice person who wanted her son to have friends. kept quiet.

And she was doing it out of niceness, not because she knew about the accident. Levi pointed to the button on his bag, his eyebrow arching in a playful manner. I imagined us watching Buggy and Floyd together. I do, I mouthed back. The two adults echanged phone numbers. The negative me said Levi's mom was doing this because she thought my uncle was unfit to look after me. The positive me said she was a nice person who wanted her son to have friends. kept quiet. She didn't even acknowledge my cookies, though I know she ate them because all that was left on the plate were crumbs. When Margot decided to go to college in Scotland, it felt like a betrayal. Even though I knew it was coming, because of course she was going to go to college somewhere far away. And of course she was going to go to college in Scotland and study anthropology, because she is Margot, the girl with the maps and the travel books and the plans. Of course she would leave us one day. I'm still mad at her, just a little. Just a teeny-tiny bit. Obviously I know it's not her fault. But she's going so far away, and we always said we'd be the Song girls forever. Margot first, me in the middle, and my sister Kitty last. On her birth certificate she is Katherine; to us she is Kitty. Occasionally we call her Kitten, because that's what I called her when she was born: she looked like a scrawny, hairless kitten. I was probably the first kid ever excited for summer to be over. There was too much free time that summer, which can lead to too much thinking; especially for a loss-tricken eleven-year-old. I couldn't wait for seventh grade to start. Todivide into schoolwork. To distract myself from the loneliest facts. At one point, I regretted turning down Dad's offer to spend the summer in Ireland with Mom's family. But I knew that if I went, there would be reminders of her everywhere. Not like there wasn't one every time I looked in the mirror. So the only escape I had was school. When I got the message that I was to report to the main office before class, I was worried I'd be faced with another year of forced visits with the school counselor, looks of pity from my fellow classmates, and well-meaning but oblivious faculty members who kept telling me it was "important to keep her memory alive". Like I could ever forget her. I wasn't ready for any additional drama that morning. It was ready the firs day of a new school year since. "Do you want me to go with you, Macallan?" Emily asked after I received my summons to the office. A tight smile on her face gave away the concern she thought she was hiding. She studied me for a second before adjusting my hair clip. I gave her a reassuring smile and kept it on my face as I entered the office. Principal Blaska greeted me with a hug. "Welcome back, Macallan! How was yout summer?" "Great" I lied. We both stares at each other, neither knowing what to say next. "Well, I'm going to need your assistance today with a new student. Meet Levi Rodgers - he's from Los Angeles!" I looked over and saw this boy with long blond hair pulled into a low ponytail. His hair was even longer than mine. He tucked a loose strand behind his ear before he reached out his hand and said, "hey". I had to give him credit - at least he had manners...for a surfer dude. Principal Blaska handed me his schedule. "Could you show him around and take him to his first class?" "Of course" I led Levi out into the hallway and started giving him the five-cent tour. A few friends passed by to say hello, everuone checking out the new guy. Our school was fairly small; the majority of us had been together since fifth grade, if not kindergarten. I stole another glance at him. It was hard to decipher if he was cute. His hair was practically white in places, probably from the sun. His tan made his light hair and pale eyes stick our even more - but this wouldn't be for very long, since in Winsconsin we rarely see the sun past August. Levi had on a checkered button-down paired with long cargo shorts and flip-flops. It was as if he couldn't decide whether to dress up or be casual. I luckily had Emily to help me pick out my firs day of school outfit that day: a bright yellow and white striped sundress with a withe cardigan. I was so thankful that I had a girly girl friend like Emily. My dad, as much as he tried, couldn't really hel me out with thing like hair, clothes, and makeup. If left to his own devices, I'd wear jeans, sneakers, and a Green Bay Packets T-shirt every day, and eat pizza for every meal. And Emily was a girl as you could get. She was easily one of the prettiest girls in our class, with long, shiny jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. She also had the best clothes, and I was so glad we were the same size so I could borrow them, although se was alredy way more developed than I was. At least I would have someone to go to once I needed a bra. I couldn't even imagine how awkward that would be for Dad. For both us.I gave Levu a quick smile, hoping to undo some of the rudeness from the morning. He returned with a sad wave. I paused for a second, and in that second, I notice the look of gratitude on Levi's face. He was expecting me to sit with him or the least invite him over. I hesitated, unsure what to do. I didn't want to play babysister, but I laso knew what it was like be alone. And scared. We talked a little more about summers, and when it was time to go, I made sure Levi knew where he was going next. It was pretty cool to have someone around here who didn't like the same things as everybody else. Uncle Adam was waiting for me after school to take me home. He was always excited to see me, even if he'd dropped me off only a few hours ago. Levi was getting into an SUV with a woman I assumed was his mom. He said something to her and she started to walk over to us. With some reluctance, he followed. A knot began to form tightly in my stomach.

When I got the message that I was to report to the main office before class, I was worried I'd be faced with another year of forced visits with the school counselor, looks of pity from my fellow classmates, and well-meaning but oblivious faculty members who kept telling me it was "important to keep her memory alive". Like I could ever forget her. I wasn't ready for any additional drama that morning. It was ready the firs day of a new school year since. "Do you want me to go with you, Macallan?" Emily asked after I received my summons to the office. A tight smile on her face gave away the concern she thought she was hiding. She studied me for a second before adjusting my hair clip. I gave her a reassuring smile and kept it on my face as I entered the office. Principal Blaska greeted me with a hug. "Welcome back, Macallan! How was yout summer?" "Great" I lied. We both stares at each other, neither knowing what to say next. "Well, I'm going to need your assistance today with a new student. Meet Levi Rodgers - he's from Los Angeles!" I looked over and saw this boy with long blond hair pulled into a low ponytail. His hair was even longer than mine. He tucked a loose strand behind his ear before he reached out his hand and said, "hey". I had to give him credit - at least he had manners...for a surfer dude. Principal Blaska handed me his schedule. "Could you show him around and take him to his first class?" "Of course" I led Levi out into the hallway and started giving him the five-cent tour. A few friends passed by to say hello, everuone checking out the new guy. Our school was fairly small; the majority of us had been together since fifth grade, if not kindergarten. I stole another glance at him. It was hard to decipher if he was cute. His hair was practically white in places, probably from the sun. His tan made his light hair and pale eyes stick our even more - but this wouldn't be for very long, since in Winsconsin we rarely see the sun past August. Levi had on a checkered button-down paired with long cargo shorts and flip-flops. It was as if he couldn't decide whether to dress up or be casual. I luckily had Emily to help me pick out my firs day of school outfit that day: a bright yellow and white striped sundress with a withe cardigan. I was so thankful that I had a girly girl friend like Emily. My dad, as much as he tried, couldn't really hel me out with thing like hair, clothes, and makeup. If left to his own devices, I'd wear jeans, sneakers, and a Green Bay Packets T-shirt every day, and eat pizza for every meal. And Emily was a girl as you could get. She was easily one of the prettiest girls in our class, with long, shiny jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. She also had the best clothes, and I was so glad we were the same size so I could borrow them, although se was alredy way more developed than I was. At least I would have someone to go to once I needed a bra. I couldn't even imagine how awkward that would be for Dad. For both us.I gave Levu a quick smile, hoping to undo some of the rudeness from the morning. He returned with a sad wave. I paused for a second, and in that second, I notice the look of gratitude on Levi's face. He was expecting me to sit with him or the least invite him over. I hesitated, unsure what to do. I didn't want to play babysister, but I laso knew what it was like be alone. And scared. We talked a little more about summers, and when it was time to go, I made sure Levi knew where he was going next. It was pretty cool to have someone around here who didn't like the same things as everybody else. Uncle Adam was waiting for me after school to take me home. He was always excited to see me, even if he'd dropped me off only a few hours ago. Levi was getting into an SUV with a woman I assumed was his mom. He said something to her and she started to walk over to us. With some reluctance, he followed. A knot began to form tightly in my stomach. I always got defensive whenever anybody met Adam for the first time. I stood there silently for a few seconds. I was used to Mudwestern politeness, but here was a woman whod just moved to town and I'd just met, and she was alredy offerind her home to me. And she was doing it out of niceness, not because she knew about the accident. Levi pointed to the button on his bag, his eyebrow arching in a playful manner. I imagined us watching Buggy and Floyd together. I do, I mouthed back. The two adults echanged phone numbers. The negative me said Levi's mom was doing this because she thought my uncle was unfit to look after me. The positive me said she was a nice person who wanted her son to have friends. kept quiet. She didn't even acknowledge my cookies, though I know she ate them because all that was left on the plate were crumbs. When Margot decided to go to college in Scotland, it felt like a betrayal. Even though I knew it was coming, because of course she was going to go to college somewhere far away. And of course she was going to go to college in Scotland and study anthropology, because she is Margot, the girl with the maps and the travel books and the plans. Of course she would leave us one day. I'm still mad at her, just a little. Just a teeny-tiny bit. Obviously I know it's not her fault. But she's going so far away, and we always said we'd be the Song girls forever. Margot first, me in the middle, and my sister Kitty last. On her birth certificate she is Katherine; to us she is Kitty. Occasionally we call her Kitten, because that's what I called her when she was born: she looked like a scrawny, hairless kitten. I was probably the first kid ever excited for summer to be over. There was too much free time that summer, which can lead to too much thinking; especially for a loss-tricken eleven-year-old. I couldn't wait for seventh grade to start. Todivide into schoolwork. To distract myself from the loneliest facts. At one point, I regretted turning down Dad's offer to spend the summer in Ireland with Mom's family. But I knew that if I went, there would be reminders of her everywhere.

I luckily had Emily to help me pick out my firs day of school outfit that day: a bright yellow and white striped sundress with a withe cardigan. I was so thankful that I had a girly girl friend like Emily. My dad, as much as he tried, couldn't really hel me out with thing like hair, clothes, and makeup. If left to his own devices, I'd wear jeans, sneakers, and a Green Bay Packets T-shirt every day, and eat pizza for every meal. And Emily was a girl as you could get. She was easily one of the prettiest girls in our class, with long, shiny jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. She also had the best clothes, and I was so glad we were the same size so I could borrow them, although se was alredy way more developed than I was. At least I would have someone to go to once I needed a bra. I couldn't even imagine how awkward that would be for Dad. For both us.I gave Levu a quick smile, hoping to undo some of the rudeness from the morning. He returned with a sad wave. I paused for a second, and in that second, I notice the look of gratitude on Levi's face. He was expecting me to sit with him or the least invite him over. I hesitated, unsure what to do. I didn't want to play babysister, but I laso knew what it was like be alone. And scared. We talked a little more about summers, and when it was time to go, I made sure Levi knew where he was going next. It was pretty cool to have someone around here who didn't like the same things as everybody else. Uncle Adam was waiting for me after school to take me home. He was always excited to see me, even if he'd dropped me off only a few hours ago. Levi was getting into an SUV with a woman I assumed was his mom. He said something to her and she started to walk over to us. With some reluctance, he followed. A knot began to form tightly in my stomach. I always got defensive whenever anybody met Adam for the first time. I stood there silently for a few seconds. I was used to Mudwestern politeness, but here was a woman whod just moved to town and I'd just met, and she was alredy offerind her home to me. And she was doing it out of niceness, not because she knew about the accident. Levi pointed to the button on his bag, his eyebrow arching in a playful manner. I imagined us watching Buggy and Floyd together. I was probably the first kid ever excited for summer to be over. There was too much free time that summer, which can lead to too much thinking; especially for a loss-tricken eleven-year-old. I couldn't wait for seventh grade to start. Todivide into schoolwork. To distract myself from the loneliest facts. At one point, I regretted turning down Dad's offer to spend the summer in Ireland with Mom's family. But I knew that if I went, there would be reminders of her everywhere. Not like there wasn't one every time I looked in the mirror. So the only escape I had was school. When I got the message that I was to report to the main office before class, I was worried I'd be faced with another year of forced visits with the school counselor, looks of pity from my fellow classmates, and well-meaning but oblivious faculty members who kept telling me it was "important to keep her memory alive". Like I could ever forget her. I wasn't ready for any additional drama that morning. It was ready the firs day of a new school year since. "Do you want me to go with you, Macallan?" Emily asked after I received my summons to the office. A tight smile on her face gave away the concern she thought she was hiding. She studied me for a second before adjusting my hair clip. I gave her a reassuring smile and kept it on my face as I entered the office. Principal Blaska greeted me with a hug. "Welcome back, Macallan! How was yout summer?" "Great" I lied. We both stares at each other, neither knowing what to say next. "Well, I'm going to need your assistance today with a new student. Meet Levi Rodgers - he's from Los Angeles!" I looked over and saw this boy with long blond hair pulled into a low ponytail. His hair was even longer than mine. He tucked a loose strand behind his ear before he reached out his hand and said, "hey". I had to give him credit - at least he had manners...for a surfer dude. Principal Blaska handed me his schedule. "Could you show him around and take him to his first class?" "Of course" I led Levi out into the hallway and started giving him the five-cent tour. A few friends passed by to say hello, everuone checking out the new guy. Our school was fairly small; the majority of us had been together since fifth grade, if not kindergarten. I stole another glance at him. It was hard to decipher if he was cute. His hair was practically white in places, probably from the sun. His tan made his light hair and pale eyes stick our even more - but this wouldn't be for very long, since in Winsconsin we rarely see the sun past August.

I imagined us watching Buggy and Floyd together. I do, I mouthed back. The two adults echanged phone numbers. The negative me said Levi's mom was doing this because she thought my uncle was unfit to look after me. The positive me said she was a nice person who wanted her son to have friends. A Fox one day spied a beautiful bunch of ripe grapes hanging from a vine trained along the branches of a tree. The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice, and the Fox's mouth watered as he gazed longingly at them. The bunch hung from a high branch, and the Fox had to jump for it. The first time he jumped he missed it by a long way. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap at it, only to fall short once more. Again and again he tried, but in vain. Now he sat down and looked at the grapes in disgust. What a fool I am, he said. Here I am wearing myself out to get a bunch of sour grapes that are not worth gaping for. And off he walked very, very scornfully. Moral of the fable: There are many who pretend to despise and belittle that which is beyond their reach. A Wolf found great difficulty in getting at the sheep owing to the vigilance of the shepherd and his dogs. But one day it found the skin of a sheep that had been flayed and thrown aside, so it put it on over its own pelt and strolled down among the sheep. The Lamb that belonged to the sheep, whose skin the Wolf was wearing, began to follow the Wolf in the Sheep's clothing; so, leading the Lamb a little apart, he soon made a meal off her, and for some time he succeeded in deceiving the sheep, and enjoying hearty meals.

Even though I knew it was coming, because of course she was going to go to college somewhere far away. And of course she was going to go to college in Scotland and study anthropology, because she is Margot, the girl with the maps and the travel books and the plans. Of course she would leave us one day. I'm still mad at her, just a little. Just a teeny-tiny bit. Obviously I know it's not her fault. But she's going so far away, and we always said we'd be the Song girls forever. Margot first, me in the middle, and my sister Kitty last.

Principal Blaska handed me his schedule. "Could you show him around and take him to his first class?" "Of course" I led Levi out into the hallway and started giving him the five-cent tour. A few friends passed by to say hello, everuone checking out the new guy. Our school was fairly small; the majority of us had been together since fifth grade, if not kindergarten. I stole another glance at him. It was hard to decipher if he was cute. His hair was practically white in places, probably from the sun. His tan made his light hair and pale eyes stick our even more - but this wouldn't be for very long, since in Winsconsin we rarely see the sun past August. Levi had on a checkered button-down paired with long cargo shorts and flip-flops. It was as if he couldn't decide whether to dress up or be casual. I luckily had Emily to help me pick out my firs day of school outfit that day: a bright yellow and white striped sundress with a withe cardigan. I was so thankful that I had a girly girl friend like Emily. My dad, as much as he tried, couldn't really hel me out with thing like hair, clothes, and makeup. If left to his own devices, I'd wear jeans, sneakers, and a Green Bay Packets T-shirt every day, and eat pizza for every meal. And Emily was a girl as you could get. She was easily one of the prettiest girls in our class, with long, shiny jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. She also had the best clothes, and I was so glad we were the same size so I could borrow them, although se was alredy way more developed than I was. At least I would have someone to go to once I needed a bra. I couldn't even imagine how awkward that would be for Dad. For both us.I gave Levu a quick smile, hoping to undo some of the rudeness from the morning. He returned with a sad wave. I paused for a second, and in that second, I notice the look of gratitude on Levi's face. He was expecting me to sit with him or the least invite him over. I hesitated, unsure what to do. I didn't want to play babysister, but I laso knew what it was like be alone. And scared. We talked a little more about summers, and when it was time to go, I made sure Levi knew where he was going next. It was pretty cool to have someone around here who didn't like the same things as everybody else. Uncle Adam was waiting for me after school to take me home. He was always excited to see me, even if he'd dropped me off only a few hours ago. Levi was getting into an SUV with a woman I assumed was his mom. He said something to her and she started to walk over to us. With some reluctance, he followed. A knot began to form tightly in my stomach. I always got defensive whenever anybody met Adam for the first time. I stood there silently for a few seconds. I was used to Mudwestern politeness, but here was a woman whod just moved to town and I'd just met, and she was alredy offerind her home to me. And she was doing it out of niceness, not because she knew about the accident. Levi pointed to the button on his bag, his eyebrow arching in a playful manner. I imagined us watching Buggy and Floyd together. I do, I mouthed back. The two adults echanged phone numbers. The negative me said Levi's mom was doing this because she thought my uncle was unfit to look after me. The positive me said she was a nice person who wanted her son to have friends. kept quiet. She didn't even acknowledge my cookies, though I know she ate them because all that was left on the plate were crumbs. When Margot decided to go to college in Scotland, it felt like a betrayal. Even though I knew it was coming, because of course she was going to go to college somewhere far away. And of course she was going to go to college in Scotland and study anthropology, because she is Margot, the girl with the maps and the travel books and the plans. Of course she would leave us one day. I'm still mad at her, just a little. Just a teeny-tiny bit. Obviously I know it's not her fault. But she's going so far away, and we always said we'd be the Song girls forever. Margot first, me in the middle, and my sister Kitty last. On her birth certificate she is Katherine; to us she is Kitty. Occasionally we call her Kitten, because that's what I called her when she was born: she looked like a scrawny, hairless kitten. I was probably the first kid ever excited for summer to be over. There was too much free time that summer, which can lead to too much thinking; especially for a loss-tricken eleven-year-old. I couldn't wait for seventh grade to start. Todivide into schoolwork. To distract myself from the loneliest facts. At one point, I regretted turning down Dad's offer to spend the summer in Ireland with Mom's family. But I knew that if I went, there would be reminders of her everywhere. Not like there wasn't one every time I looked in the mirror. So the only escape I had was school. When I got the message that I was to report to the main office before class, I was worried I'd be faced with another year of forced visits with the school counselor, looks of pity from my fellow classmates, and well-meaning but oblivious faculty members who kept telling me it was "important to keep her memory alive". Like I could ever forget her. I wasn't ready for any additional drama that morning. It was ready the firs day of a new school year since. "Do you want me to go with you, Macallan?" Emily asked after I received my summons to the office. A tight smile on her face gave away the concern she thought she was hiding. She studied me for a second before adjusting my hair clip. I gave her a reassuring smile and kept it on my face as I entered the office. Principal Blaska greeted me with a hug. "Welcome back, Macallan! How was yout summer?" "Great" I lied. We both stares at each other, neither knowing what to say next. "Well, I'm going to need your assistance today with a new student. Meet Levi Rodgers - he's from Los Angeles!" I looked over and saw this boy with long blond hair pulled into a low ponytail. His hair was even longer than mine. He tucked a loose strand behind his ear before he reached out his hand and said, "hey". I had to give him credit - at least he had manners...for a surfer dude.

I gave her a reassuring smile and kept it on my face as I entered the office. Principal Blaska greeted me with a hug. "Welcome back, Macallan! How was yout summer?" "Great" I lied. But it's true that I've never flown by myself before. And also I've never even left the country before. Would Margot meet me at the airport, or would I have to find my own way to the hostel? Josh must see the sudden worry on my face because he says, "Don't worry. Your dad will definitely let you go if I'm with you." It's later that night; Josh is long gone. Kitty and our dad are asleep. We are in the kitchen. Margot is at the table on her computer; I am sitting next to her, rolling cookie dough into balls and dropping them in cinnamon and sugar. Snickerdoodles to get back in Kitty's good graces. Earlier, when I went in to say good night, Kitty rolled over and wouldn't speak to me because she's still convinced I'm going to try to cut her out of the Paris trip. My plan is to put the snickerdoodles on a plate right next to her pillow so she wakes up to the smell of fresh-baked cookies. Margot rolls her eyes at this. She thinks I'm being dramatic, but I'm not. It's true-that's how much Josh loves Margot. He would never so much as look at another girl. "What?" For a moment I forget all about Josh. Because no matter what I am doing in life, if Margot and I are in the middle of an argument, if I am about to get hit by a car, I will always stop and listen to a story about Mommy. Any detail, any remembrance that Margot has, I want to have it too. I'm better off than Kitty, though. Kitty doesn't have one memory of Mommy that we haven't given her. We've told her so many stories so many times that they're hers now. "Remember that time ... ," she'll say. And then she'll tell the story like she was there and not just a little baby. I wave a spoonful of cookie dough under Margot's nose, and she hesitates and then opens her mouth. I feed it to her like a baby. "Wait and see, you and Josh will be back together in a day, maybe two." But even as I'm saying it, I know it's not true. Margot's not the kind of girl to break up and get back together on a whim; once she's decided something, that's it. There's no waffling, no regrets. It's like she said: when she's done, she's just done. I wish and this is a thought I've had many, many times, too many times to count I was more like Margot. Because sometimes it feels like I'll never be done. THE NEXT MORNING, MARGOT IS making coffee and I am pouring cereal in bowls, and I say the thing I've been thinking all morning. "Just so you know, Daddy and Kitty are going to be really upset." When Kitty and I were brushing our teeth just now, I was tempted to go ahead and spill the beans, but Kitty was still mad at me from yesterday, so I kept quiet. She didn't even acknowledge my cookies, though I know she ate them because all that was left on the plate were crumbs. When Margot decided to go to college in Scotland, it felt like a betrayal. Even though I knew it was coming, because of course she was going to go to college somewhere far away.

I imagined us watching Buggy and Floyd together. I do, I mouthed back. The two adults echanged phone numbers. The negative me said Levi's mom was doing this because she thought my uncle was unfit to look after me. The positive me said she was a nice person who wanted her son to have friends. kept quiet. She didn't even acknowledge my cookies, though I know she ate them because all that was left on the plate were crumbs. When Margot decided to go to college in Scotland, it felt like a betrayal. Even though I knew it was coming, because of course she was going to go to college somewhere far away. And of course she was going to go to college in Scotland and study anthropology, because she is Margot, the girl with the maps and the travel books and the plans. Of course she would leave us one day. I'm still mad at her, just a little. Just a teeny-tiny bit. Obviously I know it's not her fault. But she's going so far away, and we always said we'd be the Song girls forever. Margot first, me in the middle, and my sister Kitty last. On her birth certificate she is Katherine; to us she is Kitty. Occasionally we call her Kitten, because that's what I called her when she was born: she looked like a scrawny, hairless kitten. I was probably the first kid ever excited for summer to be over. There was too much free time that summer, which can lead to too much thinking; especially for a loss-tricken eleven-year-old. I couldn't wait for seventh grade to start. Todivide into schoolwork. To distract myself from the loneliest facts. At one point, I regretted turning down Dad's offer to spend the summer in Ireland with Mom's family. But I knew that if I went, there would be reminders of her everywhere. Not like there wasn't one every time I looked in the mirror. So the only escape I had was school. When I got the message that I was to report to the main office before class, I was worried I'd be faced with another year of forced visits with the school counselor, looks of pity from my fellow classmates, and well-meaning but oblivious faculty members who kept telling me it was "important to keep her memory alive". Like I could ever forget her. I wasn't ready for any additional drama that morning. It was ready the firs day of a new school year since. "Do you want me to go with you, Macallan?" Emily asked after I received my summons to the office. A tight smile on her face gave away the concern she thought she was hiding. She studied me for a second before adjusting my hair clip. I gave her a reassuring smile and kept it on my face as I entered the office. Principal Blaska greeted me with a hug. "Welcome back, Macallan! How was yout summer?" "Great" I lied. We both stares at each other, neither knowing what to say next. "Well, I'm going to need your assistance today with a new student. Meet Levi Rodgers - he's from Los Angeles!" I looked over and saw this boy with long blond hair pulled into a low ponytail. His hair was even longer than mine. He tucked a loose strand behind his ear before he reached out his hand and said, "hey". I had to give him credit - at least he had manners...for a surfer dude. Principal Blaska handed me his schedule. "Could you show him around and take him to his first class?" "Of course" I led Levi out into the hallway and started giving him the five-cent tour. A few friends passed by to say hello, everuone checking out the new guy. Our school was fairly small; the majority of us had been together since fifth grade, if not kindergarten. I stole another glance at him. It was hard to decipher if he was cute. His hair was practically white in places, probably from the sun. His tan made his light hair and pale eyes stick our even more - but this wouldn't be for very long, since in Winsconsin we rarely see the sun past August. Levi had on a checkered button-down paired with long cargo shorts and flip-flops. It was as if he couldn't decide whether to dress up or be casual. I luckily had Emily to help me pick out my firs day of school outfit that day: a bright yellow and white striped sundress with a withe cardigan. I was so thankful that I had a girly girl friend like Emily. My dad, as much as he tried, couldn't really hel me out with thing like hair, clothes, and makeup. If left to his own devices, I'd wear jeans, sneakers, and a Green Bay Packets T-shirt every day, and eat pizza for every meal. And Emily was a girl as you could get. She was easily one of the prettiest girls in our class, with long, shiny jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. She also had the best clothes, and I was so glad we were the same size so I could borrow them, although se was alredy way more developed than I was. At least I would have someone to go to once I needed a bra. I couldn't even imagine how awkward that would be for Dad. For both us.I gave Levu a quick smile, hoping to undo some of the rudeness from the morning. He returned with a sad wave. I paused for a second, and in that second, I notice the look of gratitude on Levi's face. He was expecting me to sit with him or the least invite him over. I hesitated, unsure what to do. I didn't want to play babysister, but I laso knew what it was like be alone. And scared. We talked a little more about summers, and when it was time to go, I made sure Levi knew where he was going next. It was pretty cool to have someone around here who didn't like the same things as everybody else. Uncle Adam was waiting for me after school to take me home. He was always excited to see me, even if he'd dropped me off only a few hours ago. Levi was getting into an SUV with a woman I assumed was his mom. He said something to her and she started to walk over to us. With some reluctance, he followed. A knot began to form tightly in my stomach. I always got defensive whenever anybody met Adam for the first time. I stood there silently for a few seconds.

Not like there wasn't one every time I looked in the mirror. So the only escape I had was school. Once upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had a little red riding hood made for her.  It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.  One day her mother, having made some cakes, said to her, “Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill.  Take her a cake, and this little pot of butter.  Little Red Riding Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village.  As she was going through the wood, she met with a wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some woodcutters working nearby in the forest.  He asked her where she was going.  The wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the shortest path, and the little girl took a roundabout way, entertaining herself by gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and gathering bouquets of little flowers. It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman's house. He knocked at the door: tap, tap. The good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out, "Pull the string, and the latch will go up."  The wolf pulled the string , and the door opened, and then he immediately fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it been more than three days since he had eaten. He then shut the door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap, tap. Little Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had a cold and was hoarse, answered, "It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you. The wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could, "Pull the string, and the latch will go up." Little Red Riding Hood pulled the string, and the door opened. The wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes, "Put the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come sit on the bed with me."  Little Red Riding Hood sat on the bed. She was greatly amazed to see how her grandmother in her nightclothes, and said to her, "Grandmother, what big arms you have!"  And, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up. but a woodcutter went into the house and take the Little Red Riding Hood and the grandmother out the Wolf's belly, 
and The Little Red Riding Hood learned the lesson and lived happily". I hesitated, unsure what to do. I didn't want to play babysister, but I laso knew what it was like be alone. And scared.

We both stares at each other, neither knowing what to say next. "Well, I'm going to need your assistance today with a new student. Meet Levi Rodgers - he's from Los Angeles!" I looked over and saw this boy with long blond hair pulled into a low ponytail. His hair was even longer than mine. He tucked a loose strand behind his ear before he reached out his hand and said, "hey". I had to give him credit - at least he had manners...for a surfer dude. Principal Blaska handed me his schedule. "Could you show him around and take him to his first class?" "Of course" I led Levi out into the hallway and started giving him the five-cent tour. A few friends passed by to say hello, everuone checking out the new guy. Our school was fairly small; the majority of us had been together since fifth grade, if not kindergarten. I stole another glance at him. It was hard to decipher if he was cute. His hair was practically white in places, probably from the sun. His tan made his light hair and pale eyes stick our even more - but this wouldn't be for very long, since in Winsconsin we rarely see the sun past August. Levi had on a checkered button-down paired with long cargo shorts and flip-flops. It was as if he couldn't decide whether to dress up or be casual. I luckily had Emily to help me pick out my firs day of school outfit that day: a bright yellow and white striped sundress with a withe cardigan. I was so thankful that I had a girly girl friend like Emily. My dad, as much as he tried, couldn't really hel me out with thing like hair, clothes, and makeup. If left to his own devices, I'd wear jeans, sneakers, and a Green Bay Packets T-shirt every day, and eat pizza for every meal. And Emily was a girl as you could get. She was easily one of the prettiest girls in our class, with long, shiny jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. She also had the best clothes, and I was so glad we were the same size so I could borrow them, although se was alredy way more developed than I was. At least I would have someone to go to once I needed a bra. I couldn't even imagine how awkward that would be for Dad. For both us.I gave Levu a quick smile, hoping to undo some of the rudeness from the morning. He returned with a sad wave. I paused for a second, and in that second, I notice the look of gratitude on Levi's face. He was expecting me to sit with him or the least invite him over. I hesitated, unsure what to do. I didn't want to play babysister, but I laso knew what it was like be alone. And scared. We talked a little more about summers, and when it was time to go, I made sure Levi knew where he was going next. It was pretty cool to have someone around here who didn't like the same things as everybody else. Uncle Adam was waiting for me after school to take me home. He was always excited to see me, even if he'd dropped me off only a few hours ago. Levi was getting into an SUV with a woman I assumed was his mom. He said something to her and she started to walk over to us. With some reluctance, he followed. A knot began to form tightly in my stomach. I always got defensive whenever anybody met Adam for the first time. I stood there silently for a few seconds. I was used to Mudwestern politeness, but here was a woman whod just moved to town and I'd just met, and she was alredy offerind her home to me. And she was doing it out of niceness, not because she knew about the accident. Levi pointed to the button on his bag, his eyebrow arching in a playful manner. I imagined us watching Buggy and Floyd together. I do, I mouthed back. The two adults echanged phone numbers. The negative me said Levi's mom was doing this because she thought my uncle was unfit to look after me. The positive me said she was a nice person who wanted her son to have friends. kept quiet. She didn't even acknowledge my cookies, though I know she ate them because all that was left on the plate were crumbs. When Margot decided to go to college in Scotland, it felt like a betrayal. Even though I knew it was coming, because of course she was going to go to college somewhere far away. And of course she was going to go to college in Scotland and study anthropology, because she is Margot, the girl with the maps and the travel books and the plans. Of course she would leave us one day. I'm still mad at her, just a little. Just a teeny-tiny bit. Obviously I know it's not her fault. But she's going so far away, and we always said we'd be the Song girls forever. Margot first, me in the middle, and my sister Kitty last. On her birth certificate she is Katherine; to us she is Kitty. Occasionally we call her Kitten, because that's what I called her when she was born: she looked like a scrawny, hairless kitten. I was probably the first kid ever excited for summer to be over. There was too much free time that summer, which can lead to too much thinking; especially for a loss-tricken eleven-year-old. I couldn't wait for seventh grade to start. Todivide into schoolwork. To distract myself from the loneliest facts. At one point, I regretted turning down Dad's offer to spend the summer in Ireland with Mom's family. But I knew that if I went, there would be reminders of her everywhere. Not like there wasn't one every time I looked in the mirror. So the only escape I had was school. When I got the message that I was to report to the main office before class, I was worried I'd be faced with another year of forced visits with the school counselor, looks of pity from my fellow classmates, and well-meaning but oblivious faculty members who kept telling me it was "important to keep her memory alive". Like I could ever forget her. I wasn't ready for any additional drama that morning. It was ready the firs day of a new school year since. "Do you want me to go with you, Macallan?" Emily asked after I received my summons to the office. A tight smile on her face gave away the concern she thought she was hiding. She studied me for a second before adjusting my hair clip. I gave her a reassuring smile and kept it on my face as I entered the office. Principal Blaska greeted me with a hug. "Welcome back, Macallan! How was yout summer?" "Great" I lied.

Not like there wasn't one every time I looked in the mirror. So the only escape I had was school. Once upon a time there lived in a certain village a little country girl, the prettiest creature who was ever seen. Her mother was excessively fond of her; and her grandmother doted on her still more. This good woman had a little red riding hood made for her.  It suited the girl so extremely well that everybody called her Little Red Riding Hood.  One day her mother, having made some cakes, said to her, “Go, my dear, and see how your grandmother is doing, for I hear she has been very ill.  Take her a cake, and this little pot of butter.  Little Red Riding Hood set out immediately to go to her grandmother, who lived in another village.  As she was going through the wood, she met with a wolf, who had a very great mind to eat her up, but he dared not, because of some woodcutters working nearby in the forest.  He asked her where she was going.  The wolf ran as fast as he could, taking the shortest path, and the little girl took a roundabout way, entertaining herself by gathering nuts, running after butterflies, and gathering bouquets of little flowers. It was not long before the wolf arrived at the old woman's house. He knocked at the door: tap, tap. The good grandmother, who was in bed, because she was somewhat ill, cried out, "Pull the string, and the latch will go up."  The wolf pulled the string , and the door opened, and then he immediately fell upon the good woman and ate her up in a moment, for it been more than three days since he had eaten. He then shut the door and got into the grandmother's bed, expecting Little Red Riding Hood, who came some time afterwards and knocked at the door: tap, tap. Little Red Riding Hood, hearing the big voice of the wolf, was at first afraid; but believing her grandmother had a cold and was hoarse, answered, "It is your grandchild Little Red Riding Hood, who has brought you a cake and a little pot of butter mother sends you. The wolf cried out to her, softening his voice as much as he could, "Pull the string, and the latch will go up." Little Red Riding Hood pulled the string, and the door opened. The wolf, seeing her come in, said to her, hiding himself under the bedclothes, "Put the cake and the little pot of butter upon the stool, and come sit on the bed with me."  Little Red Riding Hood sat on the bed. She was greatly amazed to see how her grandmother in her nightclothes, and said to her, "Grandmother, what big arms you have!"  And, saying these words, this wicked wolf fell upon Little Red Riding Hood, and ate her all up. but a woodcutter went into the house and take the Little Red Riding Hood and the grandmother out the Wolf's belly, 
and The Little Red Riding Hood learned the lesson and lived happily". I was. At least I would have someone to go to once I needed a bra. I couldn't even imagine how awkward that would be for Dad.
